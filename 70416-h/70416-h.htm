</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Though no prominent citizen is
now-a-days permitted to pass “beyond
the veil” without an account of
him being drawn up for posterity, yet
books of this sort have recently grown
so common that some warrant for the
publication of a new biography may well
be demanded.</p>

<p>Mr Burden’s public position, combined
with his sterling piety and considerable
wealth, would alone merit such
recognition: to these must be added the
fact that he was a Justice of the Peace
for the County of Surrey. His connection,
moreover, with Imperial Finance
has, through the medium of the Press,
lent a very general interest to his name
even in those parts of London with
which he was personally unfamiliar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>I am well aware that the task of
writing this history could have fallen
into abler hands, but it could have been
achieved by no one more devoted to his
subject, or more familiar with the final
catastrophe of this singularly beautiful
and modest life. That I possessed the
qualifications necessary for a work of
this kind, was so evident to writers like
Charles Egton, T. T. Batworthy, George
K. Morrel, and Mrs Hooke as to cause
them to withdraw voluntarily from a
field in which they had already—I regret
to say—laboured with some assiduity.</p>

<p>If, in the face of such a testimony, Mr
and Mrs O’Rourke persist in issuing
their ill-informed and prejudiced version
of the last sad months, I fear I am
powerless to dissuade them.</p>

<p>I had at first intended my notes for
the perusal of friendly eyes alone: to my
astonishment, I find them praised almost
enthusiastically by two powerful critics
(—journalists; valued friends; men
whose fingers are ever upon the pulse of
the nation), and a little later I learnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
that the Directors of the M’Korio Delta
Development Company would not be
displeased to see printed such a vindication
of their methods as my pen had
produced. I was assured by Lord Benthorpe,
in person, that no salaried agent
upon the daily press, nor any professional
author they had employed—not even
“Ultor”—had given them the full satisfaction
they had received from my manuscript.
I, therefore, reluctantly consented
to rewrite and publish the whole, with
such added embellishments of style and
fancy, as a wider public deserves.</p>

<p>It has eagerly been enquired by many
clergymen and others whether I had
before me a moral purpose in the compilation
of this work.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend that I had intended
it at the outset to convey any great
religious or political lesson to the world,
but I will confess that long before my
monograph was perfected a conscious
meaning inspired my pen. Rather let
me put it more humbly, and say that I
became vividly sensitive to a Guiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
Power of which I was but the Instrument.
Each succeeding phrase, though
intended for nothing but a statement of
fact, pointed more and more to the
Presence of some Mysterious Design,
and I arose from the Accomplished
Volume with the certitude that more
than a mere record had been achieved.
The very soul of Empire rose before me
as I re-read my simple chronicle. I was
convinced of the Destiny of a People;
I was convinced that every man who
forwarded this Destiny was directly a
minister of Providence. I was convinced
that the Intrepid Financier, the Ardent
Peer—nay, the Soldier of Fortune, whom
twenty surrenders cannot daunt—had in
them something greater than England
had yet known.</p>

<p>To such convictions the reader owes
those snatches of hymns, those citations
from the sermons of eminent divines,
and those occasional ethical digressions
which diversify and enliven the pages
now before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Of the form of the book I have little
to say. Type, paper, and binding I
left to the choice of specialists, as did
I also the impagination, the size of the
margin, the debate as to whether the
leaves should be uncut, and the proportion
of public advertisement requisite to
a merited fame.</p>

<p>The proofs I read myself.</p>

<p>The question of illustration was discussed
at some length. An excellent
photograph of Mr Burden was unfortunately
discovered to be the property
of a firm who had flattered him by
making it a complimentary portrait
during the last short period of his public
fame. They demand for its reproduction
a sum I have certainly no intention of
paying. No other picture of him exists
save a faded daguerreotype taken many
years ago on the occasion of a fancy
dress ball. It represents Mr Burden in
the character of Charles I., and seemed
to me wholly unsuitable.</p>

<p>The principal characters connected
with the M’Korio have, however, consented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
to sit to a mutual friend, and his
sharp if rapid impressions of their
strong features coupled with a few
sketches of Mr Burden, drawn from
memory, will aid my readers to a fuller
comprehension of my work.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Messrs Marian,
solicitors, who procured for me the best
advice of counsel upon passages since
omitted; to Mr Banks, Lord Benthorpe’s
butler, who has provided me with much
of my material. To the anonymous
author of “A History of Upper Norwood”;
to Mr English, sometime editor
of <cite>The Patriot</cite>, now manager of “The
Feathers” Tavern, Greenwich; to the
Master of St Barnabas College, Oxford;
to the chaplain and especially to the
porter of the same college; to Mr Carey
employed at St Catherine’s College, long
a servant of Mr Cosmo Burden’s; to
Lord Garry, to Mr Tammin, to Mrs
Gough, to Charles Parker, Henry
Grimm, Peter Cowdrey, C. T. Knowles,
T. Cummins, Loring, Gibbs, Hepton,
Rubble and Tuke, and to many others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
of lesser note who will, I trust, accept
this general recognition in place of a
more personal expression of gratitude.</p>

<p>The MSS. and correspondence which
have reached me from all parts of
the world have been of the utmost
service. I cannot congratulate myself
too warmly on the receipt of Mr Barnett’s
blotting-pad which his office-keeper had
the courtesy to retain for me. The
autograph letters from Prince Albert
and Baron Grant to the first Lord
Benthorpe have proved most useful
material; his grandson, the present
peer, who figures so prominently in
these pages, was good enough to sell
them at an astonishingly cheap rate to
a gentleman who was my agent.</p>

<p>Such notes, memoranda of obligations
and short agreements as have reached
Mr Cosmo Burden through me, he is
indeed happy to have received, and he
begs me to render thanks for him most
heartily in this place. I am further to
assure all who read these lines that any
further scraps in his handwriting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
may be received—especially any letters
addressed to Miss Capes—will be
warmly and substantially acknowledged.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have alluded
throughout these pages to Lord Lambeth
under his original name as Mr Barnett.
The public are more familiar with
him in this form, for Barnett is and
remains the name he has rendered
famous; and, moreover, his acceptance
of the Peerage was not announced till
half this edition had been struck off. I
have his permission for the retention of
his simple English surname. Similarly
I speak throughout my work of the
Right Rev. the Right Honourable,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the
Lord Mauclerc, Bishop of Shoreham,
as “the Rev. the Honourable Peregrine
Mauclerc.” The death of his lordship’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
brother, and his own induction to the
See of Shoreham, occurred too late for
me to make the requisite alteration.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One word more.</p>

<p>I trust I have nowhere forgotten that
delicacy in mentioning the private affairs
of others which is the mark of the gentleman.</p>

<p>If I have spoken strongly of Mr
Abbott, it must be remembered that a
patriotic duty has claims superior to
those of convention: moreover, Mr
Abbott has himself made a verbal
declaration of the strongest kind, accompanied
with an oath, that he is
indifferent to my opinions.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned in this connection
that the unhappy difficulties of
the Benthorpe family, on which I was
compelled (however reluctantly) to touch,
are of no further moment, since young
Mr Benthorpe has wooed and won Antigua,
the only daughter of the Count
Brahms de la Torre de Traicion y<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
Crapular, a Spanish nobleman of immense
resources.</p>

<p>For the rest, I have throughout striven
earnestly—and I believe successfully—to
avoid giving the slightest pain to
any sentient being.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">It is remarkable, and a little saddening, to
find how few people have heard of Mr
Burden, who recently died at his residence,
Avonmore, 37 Alexandrovna Road, Upper
Norwood. He was, all his life, a man whose
influence, though indirect, was considerable; a
man certainly not without weight in the foreign
policy of this country, and one that affected
still more profoundly its social structure.</p>

<p>The assiduity and the regularity of his demeanour
forbade him, perhaps, the notoriety
that is so prized by many lesser men. His
ambitions, where they were not domestic, regarded
his business and the preservation of the
fortune he had honestly acquired. His judgment,
which was excellent, he exercised upon
problems connected with the commercial interests
into which he had been born, and from
which he had never, during a useful life of
sixty-four years, desired to dissociate himself.</p>

<p>To the administration of the suburb in which
his villa was situated he was far from indifferent;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
but he had never attempted to enter the House
of Commons, though his station, means, and
connections would have afforded him ample
opportunities in middle age for a career which
Englishmen justly regard as among the most
honourable, lucrative and eminent.</p>

<p>Such men, happily, exercise, under the orderly
conditions of modern England, a far deeper influence
upon the fortunes of our great empire
than their lack of public fame might argue in
less favoured communities. It would be an
impertinence to insist upon the many friendships
which bound Mr Burden by the closest ties to
men who direct no small part of our national
fortunes. To those who knew him well it would
appear redundant, and, to those who had not
heard of him, beside the mark, were an account
of all his financial, philanthropic, or religious
activity to occupy any part of the following
pages. Those pages were called forth under
the strong and painful impression of his recent
death, and it is their only object to trace a rapid
sketch of his family and social position, to make
some mention of the last few days of his life,
and at the same time to leave some permanent
record, lest the memory of such a character
and of its trials should perish.</p>

<p>The name of Burden is first seen in the
beginning of the seventeenth century, when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Henry Burden appears in the court rolls of
Beccles, in Suffolk, in connection with sundry
sales of wool to Ghent.</p>

<p>It is not certain whether this Henry was
an ancestor or no; but within ten years the
name twice reoccurs, once in the form of
Burdyn, and once in that of Bird.</p>

<p>A receipt presented at Bungay, dated in the
year 1616, when our Shakespeare died, and
acknowledging payment for wood used in
burning a witch, bears the signature Barton:
and a deed of 1638 conveys and devises 47
hogsheads of mild ale to Zachary Pyorden,
who is later known for a zealous defender of
the public liberties.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that a Master
Barreden sailed for Holland from Yarmouth,
in company with some fifteen or twenty of
“God’s servants,” shortly afterwards, with a
large and very valuable cargo of wool. He
was presumably a nephew of the foregoing.
There is a family of Bourdons in Bradford,
Mass., who, though claiming a Canadian origin,
are very possibly descended from this early
champion of religious liberty.</p>

<p>No mention of the Burdens during the
Civil Wars remains. We may imagine them,
if we will, following the Parliamentary cause;
whether passively—as did so many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
sturdy East-Anglian stock—or actively; accepting
the wage, and loyally fighting the
battles of the great Protector. However that
may be, the name reappears with another
John Burden in 1672, a religious enthusiast
who preached the Word to the people of Saxmundham
during the hot summer of that year.</p>

<p>He seems to have been an honest God-fearing
man, devoted to the cause of true
religion in the first period of his ministry.</p>

<p>A government which could permit the
entry of the Dutch into the Medway, and
produce the infamous shorthand notes of a
Pepys, did not tolerate the mystical zeal of
Bunyan’s contemporary. He was thrown
into Ipswich gaol, on his release from which
place he proceeded to Aldeburgh, and
declared himself the Messiah—at some time
between April and June 1684.</p>

<p>Few believed him, but he suffered nothing
further from the authorities, and died peacefully
in the occupation of cobbling, at
Orford, on the 5th or 6th of January
1701/1700.</p>

<p>The race of Burden is then lost sight of
for nearly a century. There is almost certainly
some connection between Mr Burden’s ancestry
and that of Sir Algernon Burden, of Pelham
Thorpe, near Norwich, for Mr Cosmo Burden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
(Mr Burden’s surviving son) has recently borne
the same crest as the baronet.</p>

<p>The College of Heralds, who, under the
able direction of Lion d’Or, have accumulated
these details at a considerable expense, trace
continuous filiation from John Burden, whose
mother may have boasted gentle birth, and
who established himself as a corn chandler at
Colchester in the year 1785. John Burden,
confining himself strictly to the wheat market,
drove a prosperous business in Colchester
during the Napoleonic wars. His subscriptions
to the charities which were so necessary
in those times of high prices and public famine
appear no less than six times between 1801
and 1815. He was an Alderman of his town,
and died in 1833, leaving a son, George
Burden, whom he had established as a large
ironmonger at 106 Thames Street, in the City
of London, and who was the father of the
remarkable Englishman this memoir commemorates.</p>

<p>Mr George Burden, of Thames Street,
married on March 8th, 1835, at his parish
church of St Catherine’s, Jane Elizabeth, the
daughter of Ezechiel Cranby, a shipmaster of
Wapping. The union was blessed with two
still-born and eleven living children, of whom
my own friend, the Mr Burden with whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
these pages deal, was the third, born on January
19th, 1841, and baptised the next day under
the scriptural name of Emmanuel.</p>

<p>As is so often mysteriously the case with even
numerous families, the name of the Burdens
survived in but a single member. Of the three
other sons, James, Thomas, and Cranby, the
first died while yet a child; the second was
drowned at sea as first mate of one of his
grandfather’s vessels; and the third, whose intellect
had always been deficient, did not long
survive his thirtieth year, but passed away,
unmarried, in Dr Milford’s private home at
Reading. Two of the sisters also perished in
tender years. Of the five that survived, Charlotte
and Victoria remained unmarried, Patience
was early left a childless widow and retired to
Bournemouth, while Esther, who wedded a
wealthy Australian in June 1865, sailed with
him to Melbourne some months later, and has
never since been heard of by her family.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">MR BURDEN’S NEPHEW, HILDEBRAND WORTHING, WHOSE INHERITANCE
OF GENTLE BLOOD SADLY UNFITTED HIM FOR A COMMERCIAL LIFE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The youngest, however, who was christened
Maria, but was known in the family as “Baby,”
made, when barely twenty-six, an alliance with
the younger son of Mr Arthur Worthing, of
Worthing Court, Bucks. This marriage, whatever
social attractions it may have offered to
the younger members of the household, proved
unfortunate. Her husband was dissipated and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>improvident and encountered repeated difficulties
in the society of Boulogne sur Mer, in
France, where his father-in-law supported him
on a small pension for some years. After
the premature death of his young wife in
1873, he returned to England, led a random
and useless life among his old associates,
but had upon his deathbed the satisfaction of
knowing that his brother-in-law (Emmanuel)
had paid the greater part of his debts, and
had renovated his wife’s grave in the Protestant
cemetery of the French seaport town
where she lay at rest in God’s acre. Hildebrand,
the only fruit of this marriage, was
placed as a clerk in the office of Bowler &amp;
Co., by Mr Burden—for he was ever solicitous
of the honour of his blood.</p>

<p>At the suitable age of thirty-one, Emmanuel
Burden, who was thus destined to centre in
himself the greater part of his father’s fortune,
married a lady for whom he had felt an unvarying
attachment, and to whom he had indeed
been engaged for some eight years.</p>

<p>She was a person of modest but engaging
demeanour, the fourth daughter of the Rev.
Harward Sefton of Hagden Courtney, in the
county of Huntingdon, and of Miriam Davis,
his wife; from whom, perhaps, Mrs Burden
inherited her power of rapid calculation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
her acute judgment of human weakness. Mr
Burden’s father, while fully accepting his son’s
choice of Eliza (for such was the lady’s name),
was wisely opposed to an improvident marriage,
and deemed it prudent to make the young
people wait until his son had thoroughly learnt
and taken on the business he was to inherit in
Thames Street.</p>

<p>Their courtship, though protracted, was
peaceable and happy. They learnt to know
each other fully in the long walks which they
would take together over Hampstead or Putney
heaths. Their families even permitted sometimes
a more intimate intercourse. Young Mr
Burden (as he then was) would receive his
affianced wife in the social evenings of his
father’s house (they then resided above the
shop in Thames Street) or, in turn, would
appear as an honoured guest from Saturday to
Monday at the Rev. Mr Sefton’s vicarage:
taking the train from Liverpool Street at 1.15
on the former and returning to town by the 9.20
from Hagden Courtney upon the latter day.</p>

<p>They were married, as his father had been,
at St Catherine’s. Miss Sefton had accepted
the hospitality of her aunt for the occasion.
Rice was thrown;—and a shoe. Jests were
exchanged. The honeymoon was spent in
Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Mr Burden, senior, judged it well that the
newly-married couple should take, on their
return, a house at some distance from London.
His business had largely increased; the first
floor had already been invaded for some years
by the wares necessary to a show-room, and
the whole premises should properly have long
been given up to the storage of his goods and
the accommodation of his offices. Mrs Burden,
senior, had died during the engagement of her
son, and so at last it was arranged that a new
household should be formed on the heights to
the south of London, where the fresh air and
larger spaces of the country could be combined
with the exigencies of a daily train to town.</p>

<p>Mr Burden’s father decided therefore upon
Norwood.</p>

<p>The suburb was indeed somewhat changed
since the reign of George IV.; but nothing
could obliterate the charms which still clung
to it in the mind of the old man. In
deference to the wishes of the bride, he consented
to purchase a property in a somewhat
new and outlying portion of the Ringwell
estate. He settled upon a half acre of land,
whereon a new house already stood awaiting
a tenant. It was surrounded by gravel paths
and newly transplanted shrubs, several of which
had died. Though it still stood isolated in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
midst of bare land and fields it already bore
the number 37 in Alexandrovna Road, a
circumstance which lent an additional pleasure
to its acquirement. Some slight debate arose
between the old father-in-law and young Mrs
Burden as to what the name of the new domain
should be; the former favouring the designation
of “Chatsleigh,” the latter that of
“Avonmore,” which last, in graceful deference
to her wishes, was finally painted upon either
gate in white letters picked out with green,
upon a grey ground.</p>

<p>The house stood high, and commanded,
upon fine days, a view of London to the
north. Many familiar points in the landscape
attached Mr Burden’s father to the memories
of his laborious and successful life: the shot
tower, St Paul’s, and the roof of Cannon Street
Station were clearly visible; and he had but
to turn his gaze to rest it upon the Crystal
Palace, to which the memories of Prince
Albert and Hyde Park, his natural patriotism,
and a sense of the magnificent, made him
incline with pleasure.</p>

<p>His father having thus installed them in a
commodious and modern residence, took up
his abode with Mr Burden and his young
wife. Still maintaining his full proprietorship
in the business in Thames Street, he would at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
first visit the premises from time to time,
while he insisted that his son should leave
punctually for town by the first train after
breakfast, and at evening discuss with him
the business of the day and whatever matters
of general interest might have appeared in
the morning paper.</p>

<p>Certain of the old man’s habits would have
jarred upon a man and woman of less regular
habits, or possessed of less self-control than
were Mr Burden and his wife. Thus he had
taken, of a sudden, a considerable interest in
gardening, a matter upon which neither of the
young people felt any great concern; he
became weather-wise, and he was forever
fetching in an artizan whom he patronised,
to rearrange those bells and hinges, wherewith
his son and his daughter-in-law were already
perfectly contented. A more serious difficulty
was the attachment which Mr Burden, senior,
unexpectedly conceived for the policy of Mr
Disraeli; whereas young Mr Burden could
not disguise his loyalty to Mr Gladstone, a
sentiment in which his wife supported him
with a zeal only tempered by her repeated
references to the Irish Church.</p>

<p>Indeed, when Mr Gladstone’s windows in
Harley Street were broken by a mob, nothing
but Mr Burden’s filial piety restrained him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
from rebuking the excessive glee of his now
aged father; and when Mr Disraeli was promoted
to the peerage and offered a golden
wreath by a co-religionist, Mr Burden went so
far as to take Mrs Burden to the seaside for
a week, until the storm should have blown
over.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to insist upon these
trivial inconveniences. The respect due to
his father’s years was soon enhanced by Mr
Burden’s anxiety for his health. In the January
of 1880, Mrs Burden having by that time given
birth to three children (their grandfather’s
delight and pride), her husband, who had
long become the sole head of the great
business in Thames Street, had the pain of
seeing the old man take to his bed, whereon,
some eight months later, he very peacefully
expired.</p>

<p>It needs but little space to follow the existence
led by Mr Burden after this revolution
in his fortunes; for it is the purpose of these
few pages rather to record the impression of
his own much more recent demise, and to
leave some record of his character, than
to follow at any length the history of his
life.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">MRS BURDEN AT THE AGE OF FORTY-THREE
FROM A MINIATURE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The three children, Ermyntrude, Cosmo, and
Gwynnys, were trained in those excellent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>traditions which the family had inherited for
now three generations of decent affluence;
but Mr Burden and his wife justly considered
that the steady increase of their fortunes
(which they naturally ascribed to their considerable
capacity, but which were perhaps,
more due to the evolution of modern industry)
permitted them to entertain some legitimate
ambitions for the future of their offspring.</p>

<p>Certain developments in the structure of our
English society made it increasingly difficult to
continue the custom of taking high tea at half-past
six. This meal had already been supplanted
by a set dinner at the more fashionable
hour of seven, when Mrs Burden introduced
the change whereby her two daughters, aged
respectively fourteen and twelve years, were
withdrawn from Mrs Cathcart’s seminary at
Dulwich, and put under the care of a private
governess, a Miss M’Kee, of whom Mrs Burden
had heard from a friend who was intimate with
the niece of Lady Bagshawe.</p>

<p>Thanks to the able guidance of this lady,
Ermyntrude and Gwynnys very rapidly acquired
an acquaintance with all that best suited the
part they would be called upon to play in their
social rank. A thorough knowledge of German,
some elements of French, and a good grounding
in psychology and practical nursing, left them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
at the ages of eighteen and twenty all that
charming, simple English girls should be.</p>

<p>They came out together (for Ermyntrude
looked, if anything, younger than her sister) at
the Jubilee Ball given in the Town Hall of
Sydenham in 1897.</p>

<p>Mr Burden had never disguised his intention
of portioning his daughters. The elder was
soon married to a young doctor of considerable
ability, who emigrated with his wife to Winnipeg,
in which distant capital he still pursues a
prosperous career. Long a president of the
Orange Lodge<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in that city, he was recently
returned to the Dominion Parliament on the
Manitoba Catholic schools question; his career
will doubtless be familiar to many who may
read these lines.</p>

AN IMPRESSION FROM THE PENCIL OF A FRIEND AND PASTOR,
WHOSE HOUSE HE WOULD FREQUENT FOR THE SOLUTION OF
DOCTRINAL DOUBTS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Gwynnys, on the contrary, during a visit to
her sister in Canada, married, somewhat
abruptly, Karl P. Legros, a dark young officer
in the local army. The captain (for such was
his rank) was unfortunate in his business of
butter-brokering. He became involved,
through no fault of his own, in the collapse
and subsequent trial of the Milwaukee Butter-King.
Driven by the mysterious instinct
resident in all scions of our race beyond the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>seas, Karl P. Legros sought England in the
hour of his need; nor did England fail him.
After a short period of hesitation, and, it must
be confessed, of some spiritual anxiety, he took
Holy Orders, and was soon installed, by the
efforts of his father-in-law, as rector of the
small living of Benthanger, in Kent. He has
continued, for many years, to fulfil the duties
of his sacred calling in this place, and has been
supported unwaveringly throughout a life of
arduous and unremitting labour by his noble
and devoted wife; a true Christian matron, to
whom her father made, till his death, a small
yearly allowance.</p>

<p>Mrs Burden was laid to rest less than a year
after Gwynnys Legros’ return to England.
She had the satisfaction, before dying, of
hearing that Ermyntrude’s husband had been
elected to the Parliament of his colony, while
her visit to the vicarage of Benthanger had at
once consoled her with the vision of her
daughter’s content, and permitted her to breathe
the atmosphere of her early years: the sober
comfort of a country parsonage to which, for
all her wealth, she had so long been a
stranger.</p>

<p>This excellent woman sleeps in the Cemetery
Park of Norwood, in a dry, roomy, and well-built
vault which, with the exception of a yearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
rental of five guineas, is the unencumbered
property of her husband’s family.</p>

<p>Having thus described the fortunes of the
two daughters, it is my duty to indicate, however
briefly, the youth of their brother, Cosmo.
His participation in the last efforts of his
father’s life, and the fact that he became, after
the mother’s death, his father’s sole companion,
make it necessary to follow the young man’s
training, if we are to comprehend the failing
spirit of which he was so long the unique
support and comrade.</p>

AN INTERPRETATION BY MISS M’KEE, LONG A GOVERNESS IN THE FAMILY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cosmo had never enjoyed such health as
had his sisters. The first months of his life
had been marred by the use of an artificial
food improper to the sustenance of infants, but
honestly recommended by the old family doctor,
who had so firm a faith in its virtues as to
have accepted an interest in its sale. One
effect of this nutriment was to make the child
large and heavy beyond his years, a physical
characteristic which he preserved throughout
his life. It had also, however, the result of
weakening his heart, and permanently impairing
his digestion. From these causes he developed
as a boy a nervous and irritable temper, which
his parents thought it imprudent to correct.
When he had passed through the excellent
discipline of an English Public School, these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>faults disappeared in his general demeanour,
and were observable only in the occasional
friction that inevitably accompanies the incidents
of home-life; abroad they were replaced
by a certain indolence and indecision of manner,
far preferable to the peevishness which had
formerly given his family so much anxiety and
pain.</p>

<p>As a boy of ten, when his sisters were
barely out of the schoolroom, he was placed
in the preparatory school of Dr Stanton at
Henley.</p>

<p>Many as are the applications for admission
to this fashionable establishment, and difficult
as it was to find room for the boy, Dr Stanton
had far too much sense to hesitate upon his
reception, or to consider for one moment the
slight difference of social position between
Cosmo’s family and those of the bulk of his
pupils. The excellent divine was of that new
and vigorous school in English Pedagogy,
which rightly regards the great commercial
activities of the country as co-equal with its
territorial interests. The name of Burden
was already familiar to him, not only from the
enamelled advertisements in blue and white
which frequently met his eyes as he paced the
platforms of the Great Western Railway, but
also from the part taken by Mr Burden in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Mansion House reception of the Sadar of
Nak’, when that potentate was visiting England
during his late embroilment with the Russians.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was, therefore, delighted
to receive Cosmo, and permitted the delicate
boy certain extras which the parents of the
more robust of his pupils saw no occasion to
command. These included a plate of cold
meat at breakfast, and a weekly visit from Dr
Byle, an old and valued friend of the schoolmaster’s,
and the medical attendant of Lord
Bannering of Marlsford Park.</p>

<p>Careful as was the training which the boy
received at this excellent academy, his life was
not happy; he recovered somewhat in the refined
atmosphere of Radley, but it was not till
his entry into the University, towards the age
of twenty, that his life began to assume a normal
aspect.</p>

<p>The wealth which he would inherit, his
reserved and self-centred temperament, his
readiness to meet men of all kinds, and his
detestation of friction and quarrel, save with
those nearest to him, deservedly secured him
a number of friends of that sort which is
most prominent in our national life. He was
a member of the Club, he could ride without
discomfort, and though not himself attracted to
any games save golf and hockey, he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
associate of men who were distinguished in
whatever the University has to teach.</p>

<p>He possessed, to a remarkable degree, that
art of compromise upon which the characters,
not only of our statesmen, but of our commonwealth
itself are based. He had an instinct
for the feeling of his peers; and, if a certain
lack of energy forbade him to attempt to mould
his contemporaries, he was at least able to
receive with remarkable fidelity the general
impress of the forces around him.</p>

<p>Though not proficient in the pastime, he was
yet able, upon occasion, to write verse; and
his style in prose, which, as a Freshman, had
been somewhat inchoate and abrupt, very soon
developed that “viscosity which is more potent
than fluency” (I quote the Bishop of Shoreham),
and that “power of condensing truth
into metaphor” (I quote the same authority)
which distinguishes our modern English from
the less plastic manner of the earlier century.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is little doubt that, had he turned
his attention towards politics, or (what would
perhaps have suited his nature better) the
Church, he would have found, after a little
experience of the outer world, every opportunity,
as he had every qualification for success.</p>

<p>In the School of Modern Languages he
carried off, after four years’ study, a Second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
which was very near to being a First Class.
His father, my friend Mr Burden, already
sufficiently gratified by his son’s success, was
assured by his tutor in a private letter I have
myself seen, that Cosmo only failed to obtain
the highest distinction from a curious inaccuracy
in the spelling of Latin quotations, “a subject,”
as this careful and popular young Don<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> very
properly remarked, “alien to the spirit of the
School.”</p>

<p>At this period of life Cosmo had grown to
the manhood which his youth had promised.
His frame was soft from that fault in his early
nutrition to which I have already alluded, but
his careful grooming, his constant and regular
shaving, and his close curling hair, gave an
impression of alacrity. He stood over six
feet in height. This stature was of little advantage
to him, save with first acquaintances;
it very probably developed a weakness of the
heart, and a persistent supineness of demeanour
which, with an intellect less trained, might
have gravely affected his life. His features
were somewhat devoid of meaning, the mouth
especially: indeed he found it difficult to
control a looseness of lip and expression, which
marred what would otherwise have been a
well-set face; but he boasted a healthy colour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
red, white, and, in our colder seasons, blue.
The contour of his nose was not accentuated.
His eyes, which were of a pale grey, were
restless, and seemed always to betray a certain
anxiety. These, added to his cleanliness and
heavy gait, must complete a picture which
should be framed by the judgment of the
Master of his College: “Whatever else he is,
he is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Those whose interest in Mr Burden has
proved sufficient to carry them thus far in my
relation will excuse, I hope, the insistence I
have laid upon Cosmo’s character and early
life. It was through his son that my friend
Mr Burden came into touch with those forces
of the modern world, which might have been
of such value to him, but which proved so fatal.
It was Cosmo’s facility and social character
which had made him the intimate friend of
Charles Benthorpe, for example, of the Master
of his own College (a man most marvellously
able to estimate social influence of every kind),<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and especially of Mr Harbury, whose considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
public reputation, though he is not directly
connected with the University, is in itself the
best recommendation that can be given to his
University friends.</p>

<p>For Mr Harbury had not only known Cosmo,
he had sought to know him; and in the
multitude of Cosmo’s acquaintance there was
no one, except perhaps himself, who did not
understand what an honour and what a passport
such a friendship would become.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">It is never possible to assign to any one
cause a great catastrophe. It is even
difficult to pick out the strongest of the many
threads which go to weave a destiny. It is,
perhaps, because I knew him so well and was
so shocked by his recent death, that I find this
difficulty peculiarly apparent in the case of Mr
Burden.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to make a beginning,
and I would beg my readers to consider one of
the earliest sources of that tragedy, the unfortunate
entanglement into which his son,
Cosmo, fell while yet an undergraduate. This
entanglement had, indeed, the effect of earning
Cosmo the lifelong friendship of such men as
Mr Barnett and Mr Harbury, but it proved
indirectly a deathblow to his father.</p>

<p>Hints and suspicions have magnified and
distorted a story simple enough in itself, and
one which in its bare truth throws no dishonour
upon the young man whose whole life
it has embittered. He may himself read these
lines. He will (I am sure) think it no treason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
in his father’s friend, if I set down briefly and
exactly facts, the misapprehension of which
alone would injure him. Indeed, it is necessary
that I should do so if a comprehension is to be
had of what follows.</p>

<p>There lay about eight miles from the
University a village of the name of Mallersham.
Like Wynthorne, Gapton, Rupworth,
Bilscombe, Gorle and many others, it is the
most beautiful in England: its cottages and
peasants have about them an indefinable air of
security and content, and are the property of
the Howley family.</p>

<p>Before the recent national invention of the
bicycle, Mallersham was a place of resort for
the wealthier undergraduates; it retains the
character to this day, nor is the annual dinner
of the Brummel Club held elsewhere than at
the Malden Arms.</p>

<p>For, of course, Mallersham was originally
Malden land, and the sign of the inn is a touching
example of the deep roots which our English
families strike into the soil. For though the
Gayles, who sold the estate to the Howleys last
year, had originally purchased it in 1857 from
the Marlows, who were heirs by marriage of
the Hindes, yet the Hindes themselves had
bought it from the Kempes of Hoverton,
whose early efforts in finance bring us directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
through the Rinaldos to Geoffry Malden, the
famous soldier husband of Maria Van Huren, the
witty Dutch companion of William of Orange.</p>

<p>When Cosmo was at the University the
Malden Arms was held as a tied house by
a family of the name of Capes, whose only
daughter, Hermione, grew to inspire Cosmo
with an immature and temporary, but profound,
affection.</p>

<p>It is no purpose of these pages to
make excuses for the lad. The example of
Athletes, who often mentioned and praised the
daughter of the inn, may perhaps have led
away a temperament easily impressed by the
customary or the fashionable. Nor was the
powerful stimulus of universal and incessant
rumour the only attraction Hermione wielded.
The young woman herself could partly furnish
cause for Cosmo’s passion. She was some nine
years older than he, a circumstance which lent
to her conversation with the youth of the gentry
and middle classes a charm of experience and
arch intelligence rare enough under the conditions
of her birth. She was of a large and
commanding presence, her manner was active
and determined, her step vigorous. Her voice,
which was somewhat loud and unpleasing, was
redeemed by features in which the conventional
prudery of her rank had long been vanquished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
while her eyes, remarkable for the length and
darkness of their lashes, had achieved a fixed
expression of confident affection.</p>

<p>During Cosmo’s fifth and last year at the
University, the young people met, if anything,
more frequently than before. Mr and Mrs
Capes put no obstacles in the way of their
growing intimacy, and, towards the end of what
his father well designated his “career,” Cosmo
had the incredible folly to open with Hermione
a frequent and regular correspondence.</p>

<p>Some lawyers have maintained that this correspondence
contained as many as seven distinct
expressions equivalent to an offer of marriage.
It is a matter upon which I can express no
opinion. Nor would I dream of adding, by an
impertinent discussion, to the chagrin which a
man of Cosmo’s sensitive temperament cannot
but experience if he should read these lines.
What is certain is, that when the time had come
to sever his connection with the Malden Arms,
these letters took on an aspect of their own.</p>

<p>He had seen Hermione for the last time (as
he hoped) upon a Wednesday towards the end
of term. A natural reticence had forbidden
him to break it to her that they would not
meet again; he had affected in every recent
visit an increasing carelessness of demeanour,
and had attempted to drag out this final interview<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to so dull and purposeless a conclusion as
might properly let die a wearisome attachment.
He neglected in nothing those artifices by which
a man of refinement and honour softens the
pain he may be compelled to inflict. I record
it with the utmost pleasure of my old friend’s
son, that he showed such true delicacy in the
crisis of this lamentable story.</p>

<p>But her woman’s instinct, aided perhaps by
a more general acquaintance with such matters,
forbade Hermione to be deceived. Her tenderness
increased with every conversation, until,
in this last, it became a kind of assiduity whose
tone repelled the young man, and lent him, if
possible, a yet stronger determination to be
free; with her protestations of affection, her
enquiries and her detailed reminiscence, was
commingled a perpetual record of his cherished
letters, of their place in her heart, and of how
they seemed to keep him with her always.</p>

<p>He recalled them as she spoke. He could
find nothing in them to warrant so extravagant
a devotion. There were many recent notes
excusing his absence, many earlier ones of appointment;
he remembered not a few written
from abroad, longer letters full of description.
They reflected, of course, his regard; but he
could not understand the large part they had
played in her simple life, nor why they formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
in these days the staple of her fond and persistent
memories.</p>

<p>He was troubled and returned on the morrow.</p>

<p>The letters loomed larger than ever across
the sunset of their loves. On the Friday (for
in his anxiety he came daily) her conversation
was of nothing else, and when he showed
plainly how insignificant he thought them, she
offered to read him the passages that had most
comforted her. She whispered their purport
and drew closer to him as she told it.</p>

<p>Then indeed this topic, which had at first
only wearied and annoyed, grew to alarm him.
He dared not withdraw. He came again and
again: on the Saturday, the Sunday, the Monday;
he no longer avoided the mention of these
documents, or turned her away with careless
replies. On the contrary, they seemed suddenly—by
I know not what morbid possession of his
delicate mind—to be of even greater moment
to himself than to her. He would have touched
them, held them, borne them away with him.
She only refused, with a look of possession and
pride in her eyes.</p>

<p>Tuesday and Wednesday offered no solution,
Thursday was dangerous, and Friday sombre.</p>

<p>In this final phase of their duel, he had at
last determined upon a desperate solution of
what had grown to be a menace; he would tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
her frankly that they must part; it followed
that he would receive his letters, and he hoped,
by the aid of that tact which he justly believed
himself to exercise, to prevent a scene which
could only be painful to them both.</p>

<p>With the afternoon of Saturday he set off
once more to the Malden Arms.</p>

<p>His spirit as he went was oppressed and
confused. I have said that Cosmo was and is
(if he will forgive me the phrase) pursued by
the accidents of his childhood. His body, too
bulky and too slow, suffered from the necessity
of these daily journeys; their inconclusive
irritation preyed also upon his clear, but retiring
mind. For no reason, save that care breeds
care, and that his general tone had fallen with
the strain of these days, he saw his future
blackly as he went wearily up the hill of
Mallersham in the summer evening.</p>

<p>A healthy man of his position and inheritance
does not consider his debts, for instance;
he himself had never given them a thought till
now; he had seen them vaguely at the back of
his mind, two or three hundred pounds (£250
was the figure at which he averaged them in
more careful moments):—he had dismissed
them for more immediate things.</p>

<p>But this evening their list seemed interminable!
His father’s hearing of them, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
had put off to some future moment of success
or necessity, seemed suddenly grown terrible—a
thing not to be approached. He recalled
this and that obligation which were almost
matters of honour, and he got colder as he recalled
them. He began to imagine how men
whom he knew spoke of him in his absence.
He felt as it were enmeshed and held, though
hitherto no such imaginary follies had oppressed
him in all his youth—so much can one note of
friction enfeeble all the soul.</p>

<p>In a wiser moment he would have known that
rasp and depression of this sort would weaken
him in negotiation. It did indeed weaken him
now when he met Hermione. He so conducted
his demand that a woman of less
strength might have been guilty of a quarrel.
She fell to no such weakness. She told him
what she had told him a hundred times—all
that his letters were to her. If he himself
chose to begone, she would retain them as the
only thing remaining to her.</p>

<p>In all this her voice was finely self-possessed,
she spoke as of a property in land, a fortune;
and as she did so, discovered an unexpected
exactitude and dignity of demeanour. She
seemed—perhaps from affectation—unmoved
by his sudden gesture and his assurance that
he would not return. The letters were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
her theme, and their nature, or at least her interpretation
of them, were the last words he
heard from her lips as, much more clearly than
he wished, she still called after him across the
twilight. He would not turn his head. He left
her and pushed homeward, taxing his strength
unwittingly, and attempting a desperate hope
that she would indeed so cherish his writing
that he should hear neither of it nor of her again.</p>

<p>He reached college in utter weariness. June
was not yet ended; the weather was still cold;
he lit a fire for company, and stared at it for
an hour or more, in that terror of the future
which will oppress men of his temperament
upon any considerable accident.</p>

<p>His large, fair, Viking body seemed to grow
weak and to sink upon itself, as he sat there
tortured by thought. His face, though heavy,
was too young for this care to alter it; but all
energy had disappeared from his eyes: and his
brain, in a kind of lethargy, sought no solution.</p>

<p>The letters and his debts, his debts and the
letters, mixed in a confused nightmare. He sat
up as though determined to shake off a mere
obsession, and to seek refuge in reality.</p>

<p>He took a sheet of paper on which he had
written the heading “Saxon Origins.” He
wasted perhaps thirty seconds gazing at this,
then he put his pen through it, and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
draw up an alphabetical list. He could remember
no creditor in A——. There was
Barlton, the tobacconist; ... he could think
of no other “Ba,” except Bazeley, and “Baz”
comes after “Bar.” So he wrote “Barlton”
down at the top of the paper. Now how much
did he owe Barlton? He had a vague idea
in his head that it was something over thirty-three
pounds; indeed, he seemed to remember
the figure quite clearly. He wrote down “33.”
Then, to satisfy himself more fully, he went to
a drawer, and by good luck hit upon the bill
before he had looked ten minutes; there it
was, “£33, 14s. 7d.; but it was nearly two
years old. He pondered. There seemed to
float before his mind another bill—more recent;
he could not be at the pains of seeking it. He
“averaged” his present debt to Mr Barlton at
£55. He scratched out the 33 and wrote “55”—he
was not so far wrong; Mr Barlton had his
name on his books for exactly £58, 19s. 6d.</p>

<p>Then came Bazeley. How much did he
owe the Bazeley stable? He certainly could
not be bothered to look up all these details; he
knew about what it would be. It would be
about sixty, or, say, seventy pounds. He
would write down “75” to be on the safe side—and
he was. For Mr Bazeley, who was
a poor hand at book-keeping, had written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
out a bill at random that very afternoon, and
this bill, after some thought, he had put at
£73, 15s. 9d., an addition which he had simplified
by the formula, “Act. rendered.”</p>

<p>Cosmo was searching mentally among the
“B’s,” and had found Belper—say, twenty-eight
pounds, when he suddenly remembered
Bailey the Bookbinder. The bill was a small
one, not more than four or five pounds at the
outside—say six—but it annoyed him because
“Bai” comes before “Bar.” He squeezed
it in at the top and went on with his work.
Within an hour, after many erasures and transpositions,
he had completed the “B’s.” There
were sixteen of them, for B is the commonest
of initials; still, there were sixteen. They
came between them to a trifle over £300, did
the “B’s.” He was turning to the letter C
with a heavy heart, when he suddenly remembered
two “A’s”—Alfred the photographer,
and Aiken, of whom he had bought the saddles.
He took up a fresh sheet to make a new list,
wrote down their names, and then angrily
crumpled up the whole and threw it into the
fire. What could all this do for him? He
owed five hundred, perhaps six—probably
nearer seven—call it seven.... Anyhow he
had the prospect and the power of paying....
But as he looked fixedly at the paper, burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
before him like an expiation, a lumbering step
came up the stone stairs without, he answered
a heavy uncertain knock, and there entered
something of more moment even than his
debts: the considerable form and purpose of
Mr Capes.</p>

<p>He had his hat in his hand and bore a
sapling to walk with; his gaiters were muddy
and so were his heavy boots; but he was
dressed in his best, his scanty hair was very
carefully oiled, and a fine new comforter
adorned his neck. He came in with respectful
hesitation, and stood a moment near the
door.</p>

<p>Cosmo stood up at once. “Come in, Mr
Capes,” he said, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Mr Capes slowly; “thank
you, sir, it’s just a little matter.... I”; and
here he looked down at the carpet and followed
the pattern with the end of his sapling.</p>

<p>“Come up to the fire and sit down,” said
Cosmo. “Have something.”</p>

<p>It was a nervous peculiarity of his, common
enough in our Universities with their years of
arduous study, that he could not keep his eyes
on anyone’s face; but he spoke cheerfully
enough. Mr Capes came up and sat down by
the fire.</p>

<p>“What do you drink, Mr Capes?” said Cosmo.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_034fp" style="max-width: 59.1875em;">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Claret wine, thank you, sir,” answered Mr
Capes.</p>

<p>Cosmo brought out some College claret and
poured it into a tumbler. Mr Capes took a
gulp of it; his expression changed and he put
it down again.</p>

<p>“Would you rather have some port, Mr
Capes?” said Cosmo anxiously.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Mr Capes, “I don’t
care if I do.” There was an assurance beneath
the deference of his manner which Cosmo
could hardly bear in silence. As he stood and
poured out the port for Mr Capes in his easy
chair, he said, “Well?”</p>

<p>“Well ...” said Mr Capes, holding his
glass poised and staring at the fire ... “I’ve
been talking to my ’Ermione”; he pronounced
these two last words as though they were but
one, and he put into them a very mournful
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Now I know what you’re going to say,
sir,” he went on, putting up a large wooden
palm, while Cosmo kept his lips tight and
drawn; “I know what you’re going to say, an’
I say nothing.... I don’t want <em>to make any
unpleasantness</em>—but there! ... my poor girl!”
He shook his head up and down, and then
from side to side, still gazing at the fire.</p>

<p>Cosmo sat quite silent with his hands clasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
before him. He was under a considerable
strain, and every word that fell from Mr
Capes increased the strain till it became
almost intolerable.</p>

<p>Mr Capes continued his monologue in the
very tone and with all the pathos of a street
preacher. “She’s told me all, sir, she has.
Quite straightforward; she always was that!”
He wagged his head again from side to side,
and then up and down, “and all I can say is,”—his
voice rose, he turned round and faced
Cosmo squarely—“you owe her some com-pen-sa-tion.”
Having said that with a victorious
scansion, Mr Capes brought one open hand
down smack upon the table, and then with the
other very carefully put down his empty glass.</p>

<p>He had expected Cosmo to speak, but
Cosmo only rose and filled Mr Capes’ glass.
Then he sat down again, still silent with compressed
lips.</p>

<p>Mr Capes, like all men whose eloquence is
natural and untaught, found transition in
speech a very difficult matter. He began to
repeat himself a good deal. He said twice
that Mrs Capes agreed with him, and insisted
at least four times that he did not want to
make any unpleasantness. He uttered the
profound truth, that his Hermione would never
be the same again. And at each pause he still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
made it clear that he understood Cosmo’s
position, he still maintained his attitude of
respect, and he still came back to the only
solution that had presented itself to his rustic
mind. And still through this torture Cosmo
was silent.</p>

<p>Mr Capes was not ignorant of affairs. He
had often purchased young pigs for fattening,
and would do, from time to time, a little
horse-jobbing. He perceived that the matter
of the bargain must be touched if this scene
was ever to find an end.</p>

<p>“There are a few little things of hers, perhaps
you have by you, sir. I know there was
that pop’lar history of the war she lent you for
the maps; a rug and a brooch she says you
had—she does. Now if <em>you</em> send these back
by <em>me</em>, why, it’ll be fitting like; and then I can
bring you back some few things of <em>yourn</em> what
<em>she</em> has; there was a pin, I know, and a book
of something, and all your letters and all; if I
bring all that back to you, sir, why <em>that</em>’ll be
fitting too, so it will—and, of course,” rather
more firmly, “such com-pen-sa-tion as is fitting
also.”</p>

<p>Mr Capes was standing as though to go.
Cosmo also stood, his eyes cast down and
something like decision in his low voice.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>There is nothing in the world of business
more difficult to estimate than the sum of
ready money which the son of a rich man may
have at his disposal at any moment. Legally
he has often nothing; practically he may have
anything at all. The problem is doubly hard
for a father whose judgment is confused by
the image of a beloved and injured daughter,
and handicapped by grave imperfections of
early training. Mr Capes had only one thing
in his favour—he had made up his mind and
he was free from hesitation. He had made
enquiries some weeks ago of a tobacconist and
an ostler, and his honest mind was too robust
for indecision.</p>

<p>“Seven hundred and fifty pounds,” said he.
Then he added, by way of rounding off the
crudeness of the figures, “and not a penny
less!”</p>

<p>Cosmo had been desperate for at least twenty
minutes: there had rushed through his mind
scheme after scheme. In the last resort an
appeal to his father—flight, even, if nothing
was left but to fly. He could not bear this
interview a moment longer. He would dare
anything.</p>

<p>“Come here, to this room, at eight to-morrow
evening and you shall have it,” he said.</p>

<p>“To-morrow’s Sunday,” answered Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Capes, with a touch of reproach in his hard
breathing.</p>

<p>“Ten o’clock on Monday morning then,”
said Cosmo in better control of himself—“and—Mr
Capes, will you have some more wine?”</p>

<p>Mr Capes drank a conclusion to that evening:
pleased with Cosmo’s consistent courtesy
(he had come prepared for worse), pleased
with his own great tact, pleased with the
simplicity of himself and the world; the whole
mellowed by so much port as almost drowned
in him the memory of his poor child and her
irreparable loss.</p>

<p>That night Cosmo did not sleep; he heard
the rain falling on the flags without, and it
mingled with his despair. Towards five, the
broad daylight wearying him beyond words,
he fell into a deep, unhappy slumber, in which
he neither dreamt nor was refreshed. It was
past midday when he woke. He dressed as
carelessly as may be, breakfasted, and spun
out all the hours of the afternoon in silence,
imagining nothing, seeking no issue. He
could not even read. There had fallen on
him the dead spirit which very often falls upon
men in their evil hour, and especially upon men
by nature heavy and unalert. With the evening
he wandered round to the club, purposeless
and blank; but as he came into the main room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
he saw Mr Harbury reading in one of the
deep chairs, and the sight comforted him.
For Mr Harbury’s very appearance suggested
the world of methodical action, decision, and
ordered things.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury, who was to play so large a
part in Cosmo’s life and his father’s, was a man
such as our manifold Empire alone produces.</p>

<p>He was tall and cleanly made, his dark hair,
just touched with a metallic grey, lay close to
his head, his features were very regular and
hard; his nose was thin and slightly curved.
It possessed the more character from a flat
downward turn at the tip, as though some one
had tapped it gently with a hammer. His
mouth especially was firm, and two strong
lines, as though of a slight but just and permanent
contempt, flanked it upon either side.
The bronzed colour of his skin, his long, clear
eyes well wrinkled at the corners, the decision
of his step, all spoke of the experience of
travel and of a balanced and ready knowledge
of men.</p>

<p>He was a silent man. That modesty which
is the chief charm of our race in its highest
governing type was so ingrained in him, that
he had been heard in the last four years to
speak but twice of his family or of his own
adventures. The short and sufficient notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
which he supplied to books of reference told
the world that he came of good Lincolnshire
stock, and indeed the arms which appeared,
small and decent, upon his silver, were those
of the now extinct Harburys of Lanby; it was
presumably a cadet of this family who had
established himself as a merchant in the Isles
of the Levant two generations ago. There,
acting, we may suppose, as a chaplain or missionary,
Mr Harbury’s father had taken Holy
Orders, but at what period in his life, and
whether in the English or Maronite communion,
is unknown. Old Lady Maring has told
me that she thinks it was he whom she once
met in her father’s office when he was Consul
at Smyrna. For the rest, the few lines dedicated
to Mr Harbury’s life in “Who’s Who” tell
us that he has visited Persia and Afghanistan,
that he is very familiar with Egypt—on which
province of the Empire he has written many
articles in the <cite>Times</cite> and the <cite>Financial News</cite>—and
that his favourite recreations are shooting,
fishing, yachting, golfing, hunting, pig-sticking,
polo, and travel. He has also several clubs:
among others the <cite>Devonshire</cite>.</p>

<p>Men of this stamp cannot but influence upon
every side the destiny of our Race; the nature
of their activity is not easy to define, but it is
apparent and beneficent. His power certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
did not consist in mere wealth—indeed, Mr
Harbury’s fortune, the decent competence of
a Levantine clerical family, cannot have exceeded
a hundred and fifty thousand pounds—but
from his pleasant home within a short
distance of the University he radiated, as it
were, through twenty different departments of
Imperial life.</p>

</figure>

<p>The more serious organs of the Press, from
the <cite>Times</cite> to “M.M.M.” (<em>Money Makes Money</em>),
regarded him as a specialist upon Imperial
problems; he would leave England some three
times a year for Africa or the near East; he
had lectured upon the fauna of Socotra; he
was the friend and associate, in a sense, the
<em>link</em> between those very varied types of administrators,
soldiers, and financiers, who between
them build up that which the world has
not seen since Rome decayed. Two men who
would mutually suspect or despise each other—for
example, a somewhat narrow though upright
general officer, and a brilliant and daring
speculator—would each be friends of Mr Harbury.
Mr Harbury knew how to use what was
best in each for the common good of England.
Lord Hayshott—a man by nature contemptuous
of finance; Sir Jules Barraud, of the
Canadian Copper Syndicate and the Anglo-French
Quick-silver Group; Henry Borsan, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>Leeds; Mrs Warberton, who perhaps had more
influence in British East Africa than any other
white woman; were each indebted to him for
services and friendship. What is more significant,
it was Mr Harbury who had first pointed
out to Mr Barnett all that the University meant
to the Empire; how through the University
the Empire could best be trained to its last
ventures, and, I believe—no one can prove it—that
the idea of the Mercantile Scholarships
was Mr Harbury’s rather than Mr Barnett’s
creation. If Mr Barnett was at that moment
the guest of the Principal of Barnabas, it was
Mr Harbury who had introduced him to that
new world.</p>

<p>With the name of Mr Barnett, however—a
name which calls up to all Englishmen affairs
of far greater moment—I am touching upon
the principal subject of these few pages: that
unhappy misunderstanding concerning the
M’Korio Delta, and its fatal issue for Mr
Burden, my friend. Let me leave these to
their proper order, and return to Cosmo in
his despair.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury knew Cosmo and liked him.
He wished to know and like him better. He
saw in a moment into what mood the young
man had fallen, and he guessed at once—if not
the exact cause of it—at least the general nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
of Cosmo’s necessity. He saw “money” there
quite plainly, like a written thing.</p>

<p>Cosmo attempted conversation and failed.
Mr Harbury threw his paper to the floor and
turned a trifle towards him.</p>

<p>“Burden,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cosmo.</p>

<p>“Dine with me to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m not fit to dine with anyone ...”
said Cosmo, and as he said it he mentally
added 700 to 750, and rose uneasily and
then sat down again, leaning back with his
hands dropping listlessly on the arm of the
chair.</p>

<p>Cosmo prided himself—and justly—upon his
reticence: but then Cosmo had never been tortured
till now ... he said to himself that
Harbury was an older man ... he knew him
for a silent and a wise man ... he looked at
his companion, a side-long look, and said,
blurting it out as though to get it over, but
putting on the conventional smile wherein
very inexperienced men of breeding hide all
extremity and confusion:</p>

<p>“I’ve got to make a payment to-morrow at
ten o’clock—and I must spend my time looking
for it—but I sha’n’t find it, Harbury. It isn’t
there, you know.” Then he paused, glad to
have found words of a virile flippancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Mr Harbury wanted to laugh, but he
looked grave. “How much, Burden?” he
said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t sleep all night,” answered Cosmo
savagely.</p>

<p>“Yes—but how much is it?” pressed Mr
Harbury with patience.</p>

<p>“Oh!... It doesn’t matter—so long as it’s
out of reach, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Mr Harbury was decisive:</p>

<p>“It’s never any good mentioning the <em>word</em>
money unless you speak of exact sums,” he said.
Mr Harbury knew what he was talking about,
and Cosmo’s hesitation began to yield: he
wavered a moment, and Mr Harbury sat quite
still, as fishermen do over dark smooth waters
at evening.</p>

<p>Young men are often timorous in the presence
of great sums of money; they do not
understand the modern ease and fluidity, the
come and go, of wealth.</p>

<p>Cosmo rather whispered than said, “A
thousand.”</p>

<p>Mr Harbury smiled, so spontaneously and so
brightly, that he seemed for a moment hardly
older than Cosmo himself.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow...!” he said. “My
dear fellow.”</p>

<p>Then his smile broke into an honest little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
laugh. He sat up in the deep padded chair
and put one hand upon Cosmo’s knee:</p>

<p>“Is that what has been worrying you,
Cosmo?”</p>

<p>Cosmo Burden started at the noise of his own
name. He had taken Mr Harbury’s popularity
for granted during full four years, but he
had not quite understood why that quiet, dark-haired
man had made so many friends, nor why
he had lost none; why, living at some distance,
travelling much, appearing only as a visitor or
guest, he had increased his value till he
seemed a kind of centre for all that counted
most in the University. He knew now: Mr
Harbury had used his travels; he could help.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury also felt a kind of gladness at
the same moment; for he knew that he had
gained one more friend, and friends to all such
men are (if we only knew it!) the dearest part
of the comfort they so easily attain.</p>

<p>He said it again, laughing in the goodness
of his heart:</p>

<p>“Is that what has been worrying you,
Cosmo?”</p>

<p>“It is enough to worry about,” said Cosmo.
He said it with his head still down, and he said
it miserably. But there was hope in his voice.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury lay back in the attitude of a
man wearied by repetition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“There are fifty men who would give it to
you within the next two hours,” he said.</p>

<p>Cosmo, who had read many books, shook
his head with a certain firmness, answering:</p>

<p>“I am determined not to borrow from my
friends.”</p>

<p>Then he got up, and walked towards the
window, and gazed out into the rain with that
expression upon his face upon which depends
the manliness of our youth.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury looked at him as he stood those
few feet off in the grey light, with his face
averted. He turned in his mind all that he
knew of men embarrassed, of young men who
did not know the nature of the world, and then
he said quietly:</p>

<p>“I will let you have it myself.”</p>

<p>But Cosmo repeated the phrase he thought
best:</p>

<p>“I have already told you, I will not borrow
from my friends,” and he deepened the expression
of manliness, and stood quite firm where
he was. Mr Harbury was genuinely impatient.</p>

<p>“Then borrow it in the regular way,” he
said, “but whatever you do don’t get a sum
like that on your nerves ... people are so
funny about money when there’s any hurry....”</p>

<p>Then he turned round sharply and cried:</p>

<p>“Good Lord, it isn’t worth all this fuss.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Borrow it from some regular man—De Vere,
or Ashington, or Massingberd, or somebody....
They know who you are.”</p>

<p>“I know what happens when people do <em>that</em>,”
said Cosmo, for he had read a thousand things;
and then he added, “<em>Sixty per cent.</em>,” as though
it was a kind of secret password, showing him
to have a vast experience of mankind.</p>

<p>In spite of his good nature, Mr Harbury was
almost angry with a young man aghast at a
thousand pounds, using fine phrases and bringing
in the 60 per cent. of the police-courts and
the novelists; the 60 per cent. which farmers
pay, and poor widows, and insignificant officers
of the line, and men hiding, and all who have
no backing.</p>

<p>“Cosmo,” he said firmly, so that he made
himself obeyed, “you say this man is coming
at ten to-morrow. I will come at nine and
bring you the money—in notes, mind you—in
notes. Then, since your nerves are in that
state, we will go up to town and I will take
you to Ashington. I know him as well as I
know you; he will lend it you at 15 per cent.
at the very most, and I will see that he does
it; and if you must clear your mind, you can
pay me then. Sixty per cent.! Oh, Cosmo,
Cosmo, what a lot you have to learn.”</p>

<p>Cosmo waited a little, as they do in story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
books, and then Mr Harbury saw by his face
that he had consented, and Mr Harbury laughed
again a clear laugh, and put his hand upon his
shoulder, and Cosmo, from whom certainly a
great weight had gone, asked him where he
was dining, and said he would come too.</p>

<p>At Mr Harbury’s dinner, half academic and
half political, Cosmo met a group of those men
who are in the very core of our lives to-day, and
who principally direct our State and its great
destinies, and heard in silence the Master of
Barnabas, Charles Gayne and a dozen other
people who were arranging the new Mercantile
Scholarships; Professor Ezekiel K. Goode,
Ph.D., was there, the creator of Hylomorphism
as a system of thought-being; and next to
him there sat a man named Ragge, whose
mother had done a great work in the East
End.</p>

<p>But especially he noticed at the other end
of the table the large and ponderous face, the
dominating gesture, and the lethargic eyes of
a man whose very name betokened something
great; it was Mr Barnett, upon whose direction
the scheme depended. And that evening
he heard also for the first time, casually mentioned,
a phrase that was to have great power
over his life—the Development of the M’Korio
Delta. He heard it appearing and reappearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
at intervals in the conversation, as fire-flies
dart in and out of trees.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Next morning Mr Capes came, still respectful
and still determined. But Cosmo’s manner
was all renewed and strong: he met Mr Capes
with a vigorous, sharp manner that astonished
him, and spoke the first words loudly:</p>

<p>“You know what I think, Capes. It’s
blackmail. You know that as well as I
do. He pulled out the money as he spoke.
“Where’s your packet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to be spoken to like that, sir,”
said Mr Capes.</p>

<p>Cosmo in his relief insisted more strongly.</p>

<p>“I can’t help that, Capes; you must hear it
now, for I hope never to see you again. It’s
blackmail. I said I would pay it, and I will
keep my word; but it’s blackmail, and it
shall be remembered against you till I
die.”</p>

<p>Mr Capes was foolish enough to say at
this point, that he hoped there would be no
unpleasantness.</p>

<p>“Count them,” said Cosmo.</p>

<p>Mr Capes took the notes and turned each
carefully over as though he feared a trick.
Then he ran through them again by the aid
of his great thumb, which he put to his mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
from time to time as he counted half aloud.
He was satisfied.</p>

<p>“You owe it us, sir,” said he slowly, “certain
you do.”</p>

<p>Then he put the price of a comfortable life
into his pocket-book, wagged his head sadly,
and brought out from his tails a package
wrapped up in a very dirty old newspaper.
He unfolded it and produced an inner packet
tied with a thick and greasy string, and Cosmo
sighed slightly as he felt his own hand on the
envelopes, and took back the letters and with
them his peace of mind.</p>

<p>“I hope,”—began Mr Capes.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to have any more words
with you, Capes,” said Cosmo, trying to set
his mouth, and still speaking with depth
and loudly.</p>

<p>“Oh! very well, sir,” said Mr Capes respectfully,
“very well, sir,” and he moved slowly to
the door and shut it after him very gently, as
he had ever been taught was good manners.
And Cosmo heard his shamble on the stone
stairs, and felt as though peril had gone with
him, and as though in some way his own
manhood had returned.</p>

<p>He took the packet and had just untied the
string, when his eye caught the clock, and he
saw he had barely the time to meet Mr Harbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
at the station. He put the letters into
his desk, locked it, and went out free.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That morning Mr Harbury took Cosmo to
town, to Jermyn Street; and there the two
went up a flight of stairs and came to a door
which bore, on a brass plate, the name of
“Ashington.”</p>

<p>There was a decent clerk of middle-age
writing at a desk. He came forward courteously,
and took from Mr Harbury’s hand a
note which was addressed to his master. It
was to introduce Cosmo and himself, and to
tell their business. The clerk came out again
at once. He first bowed out a very old man,
a client whose hands were shaking, and then
bowed in through the green baize door the two
new visitors. Then he shut the green baize
door, and Cosmo, in some awe, sat down and
looked about him.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">MR ASHINGTON, FROM A PORTRAIT—(UNDER HIS COUNTRY NAME OF
MR CURLEW) IN “HOSTS AND HOSTESSES OF RUTLANDSHIRE”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There was a large table with two novels
upon it, and a great inkpot, and two silver
candlesticks, and a piece of sealing wax, and a
lovely little statuette of Napoleon in bronze.
There were also some letters upon the table,
and two envelopes waiting for the post. And,
sitting at the table, was a little elderly man,
with kind keen eyes and a kind smile, but
coughing and weak in health, who blinked his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>eyes and twiddled his mouth as he spoke. And
when he spoke he had another nervousness,
which was to repeat his phrases; and he
began by saying:</p>

<p>“Well, well,” and then he said it again, and
smiled and added: “it’s very simple, Harbury,
it’s very simple. I suppose that this gentleman
is of age?—is of age?” He looked kindly again
at Cosmo, and added: “is of age?”</p>

<p>Cosmo said that he was twenty-three. He
was afraid it might have been bad form, or he
would have mentioned birth certificates and
proofs; but this statement appeared enough;
he was astonished at the ease with which these
mysterious things were settled in this new great
world which he had never known.</p>

<p>The little old man got up, walking with
knees rather bent, and with short steps, saying:</p>

<p>“I’ll get a form, I’ll get a form, Harbury;
I’ll get a form.” And he went to another door
at the end of his little room.</p>

<p>In the silence Cosmo looked at the walls,
he noted their taste and comfort: the excellent
English mezzotints of Italian workmanship, and
the air, in every subdued decoration, of harmony
with the English air and manner, the old
dignified English quarter in which this English
house had been built two hundred years before.
His mind was still upon these charming characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of security and repose, when Mr Harbury
said to him quietly and with a smile:</p>

<p>“Cosmo, I have asked for £1250.... I am
determined that you shall have something in
hand; you must have your mind quite free ...
when the work you may have to do begins.”</p>

<p>And Cosmo did nothing but smile in answer
a little sadly, and nod once or twice.</p>

<p>Then old Mr Ashington came toddling back,
put on gold spectacles with great elaboration,
laid the form on the table by Cosmo, and,
bending over it, followed down its few clauses
with his delicate white finger, and Cosmo read
them, murmuring their words; and then old
Mr Ashington said:</p>

<p>“That’s where you sign; that’s where you
sign; that’s where you sign.” And Cosmo
signed, and the thing was done.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The M’Korio Delta lies, as its name implies,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
at the mouth of the M’Korio river.</p>

<p>This protracted and beneficent stream was
first seen on the 10th July 1863, by the noble-hearted
Garry, who, coming across it in the
rainy season, and mistaking the character of
the waterway, christened it “Lake Coburg.”
He crossed it, and pursued his way without
discovering his error.</p>

<p>It was next visited (unless we accept the
very doubtful story of Van Arlst two years
before) by the intrepid Matherson in 1867.
Matherson had the misfortune to cross it in the
middle of the dry season, and was wholly unaware
of its importance. On his historic map,
which is still preserved by the Royal Geographical
Society in Burlington Gardens, the spot
is marked with the words “pools here”; and
there is a marginal reference to a carrier,
recently converted to Christianity, but devoured
in this neighbourhood by a crocodile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>The true discoverer of the river, the first to
recognise its nature and to map its course was
the saintly Basingstoke, a pupil of the N.K.C.B.</p>

<p>Basingstoke was very probably born in
Murphy county, N.S.W., on the river Thames
a few miles above Tarára. On reaching
England he did what his right hand finded to
do and displayed in several houses a devoted
and God-fearing manner which earned him a
written character from his last master, Mr
Heck, of the Lindens, Fulham. Armed with
this he passed to the Continent, worked for
some time in what is now the Grand Hotel at
Assisi and so encountered the chief adventure
of his life.</p>

<p>It was due to a recommendation from this
hotel that Basingstoke started from Naples in
March 1873, in the company of an Italian
named Mucciani, who boasted some foreign
title or other, and was possessed of ample means.</p>

<p>This man died; how and where will never
be known, for in the awful days of fever that
followed nothing but a most exceptional valour
saved Basingstoke himself from destruction.
We have it in his own hand that “he had no
conception where he was or what he did,” and
that the clothes and personal effects of Mucciani
(which it had been his business to brush and
clean) were “lost in the period of delirium.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
But, he finely adds, “I must succeed; I know
when God is on my side.” The phrase is
typical of the man’s true humility, and helps us
to understand his power.</p>

<p>The blacks put an absolute trust in him.
Just above the Harra rapids (below which
point the Italian notes on the map are first
misspelt and then cease altogether) he was
compelled to shoot two of his carriers for prevarication—to
call it by no harsher name.
The whole company fled into the woods, and
he was left alone with one man, Mahmoud,
whose devotion had in it something of hero
worship. They had no weapons left, save
one rifle, fifteen cartridges, and a heavy whip;
all these Basingstoke, as the stronger of the
two men, carried without complaint to the
journey’s end. Roped together, lest they
should lose touch in the thick brushwood,
these gallant fellows stumbled on, till they
emerged at Háli (or Gambetta as the place is
now called) more dead than alive, and received
aid from a friendly tribe who knew and trembled
at the English name.</p>

<p>Miracles, if one may use the term with
reverence, were worked for them upon their
journey down the river from this spot to the
coast, a hundred and fifty miles away. At one
place their canoe was surrounded by a clamorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
horde of natives, who were silenced by
the reading of that magnificent passage, Genesis
xxxvi. 22-28 inclusive. At another they were
pursued by a she-hippopotamus of enormous
dimensions; at a third they dared not land for
fear of lions; at a fourth they touched at a
native village in the very nick of time barely
three hours after the death of a mighty serpent.
Upon reaching the mouth of the river they had
every reason to fear that they would be fired
upon by a Portuguese gunboat. Basingstoke
quietly stretched his white handkerchief upon
a reed; the emblem was recognised and he
passed in safety. Three days at sea exhausted
their provisions. Basingstoke has recorded
the generous struggle between himself and
Mahmoud and told us in unforgettable language
how the servant slid into the water by night
to save his master.</p>

<p>Many of us can still remember his reception
in Europe, his plea at Exeter Hall for those
millions whom he had found in darkness, his
decoration by the King of Italy, and his
successful lawsuit against the family of Mucciani.</p>

<p>The end of this great man is less well known.
Years after, when unfortunate speculations had
dissipated his considerable fortune, he returned
to Gambetta, but he only returned to
die. His life was wasted. The valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
deposits of mineral oil, upon which he had
pinned his hopes were already in the hands of
a foreign concession. His heart broke. He
lies buried in a field just outside the limits of
Gambetta, under a fine monument bearing the
simple inscription:</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">
<em>C. M. Basingstoke,<br>
Born at Beatrice, N.S.W., on the 6th July 1841,<br>
Educated at the Mason’s Orphans’ College, Clapham,<br>
Died Jan. 6th, 1895.</em><br>
<span class="fs80">“<em>I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer upon the earth.</em>”</span><br>
</p>

<p>It is to Mr Barnett’s honour that he paid for
the monument, which is of Cornish granite inlaid
with plain black. The whole is of British
workmanship, designed in Battersea by one of
the Chelsea artists, executed in Camberwell,
transported by the well-known firm, B. L.
Jowel &amp; Co. of Holborn Viaduct, shippers, etc.
It was set up by Burroughs. Photographs of
the same are to be obtained of Mr Gale, 742
Strand, and a tablet has been erected in Westminster
Abbey by American subscription.</p>

<p>After Basingstoke’s great effort, several
travellers appeared in succession in the
M’Korio valley, and completed his work.
Each entered after incredible exertions through
the Kuru gorge; each descended the river to
its mouth, bearing his life in his hands, each
survived, and each published a book upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
return to England. Bayley Pasha in 1876,
the indomitable Higgs in the same year, poor
Lord Charles Hampton in 1878-79, and “Hell
or Glory” Powell, in 1880, achieved the
exploration of the country. These, together
with a few rather noisy continental claimants
to similar honours, were the pioneers. Sir
Henry Jeorz signed the first treaty with the
Noyo of Naya in 1882, thereby overriding the
previous arrangement which that sovereign had
signed with some German adventurer. Next
year a similar footing was obtained in the town
of Saràka and the surrounding district by the
genius of Captain Ronald, who deposed and
exiled the Alemami, forbade polygamy, put
down the slave trade with a rigorous hand,
publicly burned the Sacred Umbrella, and was
on the point of executing a Belgian botanist,
when news of his exploits reached England,
and he was suddenly recalled by the Secretary
of State for War, a personal friend who had
long mourned him as dead.</p>

<p>Ronald was given an excellent post, and has
since enjoyed all that public repute and a
wealthy marriage can afford, but the error of
his recall was the beginning of a series of
official blunders, which all but forfeited the
fruit of so much private heroism.</p>

<p>So long as Mr Gladstone continued by his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>marvellous personal influence to concentrate
English opinion upon parochial matters, the
valley of the M’Korio remained upon the map
as British territory; it was taken by our neighbours
and rivals to be in some vague way
attached to the British Empire, the Portuguese
claim to the settlement at the mouth of the
river was tamely submitted to arbitration,
upheld, and finally bought out for the monstrous
sum of eighty-three thousand seven
hundred and forty-six pounds. A few stations
scattered along the eleven hundred miles of
the stream, each occupied by a mere handful
of troops—these and the missionary enterprise
peculiar to our race alone maintained the prestige
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>With the great national movement of 1886,
this dangerous and unworthy state of affairs
came to an end. A Government which comprehended
the meaning of the word Imperial
proceeded to the partition of Africa. So far
as the M’Korio was concerned, that partition
was marked by a majestic simplicity. The
whole of the right bank was recognised as
falling within the sphere of influence of the
French, with whose acknowledged possessions
in Africa these districts ultimately merged.
The whole of the left bank, right up-country
as far as the Cameroons, was similarly adjudged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
to Germany. We retained for our portion no
useless shadowy sovereignty over the immense
spaces of the interior, but the solid and tangible
possession of the Delta. The future may yet
show that we there established our power over
one of the most valuable territories of the earth.</p>

<p>This Delta has a frontage upon the sea of
some 145 miles. It is contained between two
main branches of the river, which meet at a
distance of about ninety miles from the coast;
but, as is nearly always the case in such formations,
the M’Korio also finds its way to the ocean
by a very great number of smaller channels.</p>

PRINCIPAL HOPES OF AN IMPERIAL EDUCATION OF THAT PROVINCE
DEPEND</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By no means the whole of this province is
permanently under water. There are several
considerable islands of firm earth, sufficient to
afford sustenance for a sparse but combative
population which is split up into some five or
six distinct tribes, but is known to the surrounding
natives under the collective name of the
Yaba. The reduction of these our fellow-citizens,
“half devil and half child,” would
probably have proved too heavy a task for any
troops save those who had been trained in our
own magnificent and permanent school of
colonial warfare. As it was, a short campaign
sufficed to establish that <em>Pax</em> which the commander
in his despatches cleverly termed
<em>Britannica</em>. Before the month of December
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>1887, the army was able to re-embark upon the
<em>Princess Mary</em>; its task was accomplished.</p>

<p>The rising of 1888 was more difficult to deal
with, and that of 1889 (which may be regarded
as one with the disturbances of 1890) put the
local resources of our power to a very severe
strain. Three officers, seven white non-commissioned
officers, and no less than 120 native
troops perished of fever before order could be
finally restored.</p>

<p>The rebellion of 1891 was a small matter,
purposely exaggerated by the unpatriotic section
of the House of Commons, and by the
jealousy or ignorance of the Continental press;
indeed, for three full years no military operations
were necessary, and even the armed disaffection
which appeared in 1894 could hardly
be dignified with the name of a rising; while
the obscure movement of 1897, of which we
heard so much in this country, appears to have
been little more than an outbreak of intertribal
bickering, which it was our easy duty
to suppress.</p>

<p>The general upheaval, which began in January
1900, was a far more serious matter. The
temporary difficulties which we were then experiencing
in the south of the African continent
were not without their re-echo in the central
north, and, ludicrous as it seems, the Yaba may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
have thought, in company with more serious
competitors, that a term had come to our
national mission. They were undeceived.
Difficult as it was to spare men, a sharp campaign,
lasting into the first months of 1901,
and unfortunately neglected in the noise of
greater events, finally pacified the country.
At the same moment the Delta was formally
annexed and a governor appointed.</p>

<p>With the rebellion of 1902 it is not my purpose
to deal. The event is too near us in time
to permit of an impartial estimate, while the disturbances
of 1903 have not yet been reported
upon, and those of 1904 are but their sequel.
Moreover, the events with which this chronicle
has to deal date from an accident prior to this
last campaign. That accident was the presence
upon this coast of Mr I. Z. Barnett.</p>

<p>It is time that I presented to my readers a
presentment of this remarkable man with whom
so much of the following pages are concerned.</p>

<p>It may seem an impertinence in me to do so.
His name is familiar enough to the whole world
for such a description to seem superfluous. It
must be remembered, however, that I have frequently
come into personal contact with his
genius, that he was for some months the
financial guide of the dear friend whose record
I desire to establish, and that he would—had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
that friend’s weakness permitted it—have remained
his guide to the end. Indeed, the just
description of this great Builder of Empire is
a duty which I owe, not only to the memory
of Mr Burden, but to Mr Barnett himself. He
has furnished me with many of the materials
of this work, and he will be the first, not only
to endorse, but to applaud my confidences.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett’s offices in Broad Street are well
known to everyone in the City. Under the
name of the M’Korio Delta Development Co.,
they are, as Mr Barnett has himself strikingly
put it in the <cite>Intellectual Review</cite>, “a household
word.” They occupy, of course, Nos. 73, 75,
77, 79 and 81 of Golden Square House. It is
not so generally known that, under the business
name of the “British and Levantine,” they
stretch over Nos. 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95,
97 and 99 of the same building. Five rooms
of the ground floor (under the name of Bury
&amp; Co.) and a considerable part of the basement
devoted to the XXth Century Wine Company
are in the same hands.</p>

<p>But this position was not immediately reached.
The brain and the manhood which were capable
of such an achievement merit a brief biography,
were it only to show by what virtues of steadfastness
and application our country has come
to stand where she does.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Mr Barnett was born at Frankfort a/M.,
somewhere between June 1840 and March
1845. In youth he must have been strikingly
handsome. A photograph, taken at Mayence
in 1863, shows us a mass of black crisp hair,
glittering eyes, promising a singular depth and
power; full and somewhat sensuous lips, comprising
between them a mouth of immense
tenacity; a broad, high forehead of a startling
paleness; and a nose of that full pendulous
type which is invariably associated with
organising ability and staying-power. The
prominence of the cheek betrays some strong
potentiality for emotion; but it is especially
the attitude of the whole figure that indicates
the mind within.</p>

FROM THE PORTRAIT BY SIR HENRY MOSELEY, R.A., K.V.O.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The young man is shown supported by a
small pilaster, in the German manner of the
period. The right hand is thrust negligently
into the pocket of the trousers; the left grasps,
in fingers of a certain obesity, a book which
we believe to be an English Bible.... There
is something further—something which a
written description can hardly convey, but
which carries one away as one gazes at the
magnificent coloured enlargement which hangs
to-day in the hall of Mr Barnett’s house in
Charles Street.... It is an impression—a
conviction rather—that this man is in some inscrutable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>way linked with the fate of England.
Such an assertion in cold print means little;
made in the presence of the man or his
emblem, it has the force of prophecy.</p>

<p>To-day the figure and the face are changed.
Forty-five years do not pass without leaving
their mark, even upon the Heroes of our
strenuous epoch. An increasing stoutness—the
hereditary enemy of his family—has affected
the gait and figure of Mr I. Z. Barnett. His
once luxuriant black curls are fallen. His head
is surrounded by a short ring of reverend grey
hairs, still crisp, however, and still admirably
barbered. The clean-shaven face of the Mayence
photograph boasts the whiskers of later
middle age that meet above the mouth in a
manner luxuriant, but quaintly foreign still.
The chins are heavier and more rumpled, and
the whole face softer and more drooping.
Failing eyesight, coupled with a keen regard
for dignity, have compelled Mr Barnett to the
use of plain gold eye-glasses held by a simple
tape. These, with a couple of rings upon the
left hand, a heavy signet, a bunch of curious old
family seals at his watch chain, some large pin
or other, a well-chosen stud, and two cuff links
of Russian opals, comprised the whole of his
ornament. In dress, however, he is careful and
even scrupulous—a habit that accompanies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the excessive personal self-respect which is an
only, and a most forgivable, weakness. In
colour he affects the maroon; in pattern, a
quiet check; and he is careful to hide the
ungainly join between the trouser and the boot
by a pair of snowy spats. Gloves he rarely
wears. His hat is modish.</p>

<p>His philosophy and manner are perhaps of
greater import. Himself an agnostic, he has
ever extended his religious sympathies beyond
the narrow boundary of creed. His spiritual
outlook from of old was frank and tedious at
times, yet always genial and always helpful in
intention. His deeper conviction was best expressed
by the phrase he invariably used upon
completing the complicated formulæ of some
legal document: “My word,” he would say
upon such occasions, “is as good as my bond.”
At some considerable distance one would have
recognised the man who had succeeded and
who had deserved success.</p>

<p>But that success had not come easily.
Indeed, until the last magnificent piece of
daring upon the M’Korio it could not be said
to have come permanently at all.</p>

<p>His birth was a continual drawback: the
change of name necessary to his career in
England was another: the slight accent
which he retained throughout his career<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
a third. We are a conservative and jealous
people, and it is with difficulty that we will
admit the genius of an alien, even when that
genius flatters or would enrich us.</p>

<p>That Mr Barnett should suffer from such a
prejudice was in his case a peculiar hardship.
His mother, the daughter of an Englishman
settled in Lisbon, was related in some way to
Admiral Sir J. Cowen. His father, though
technically a German, was one to whom our
fullest sympathy should extend. A patriot
and idealist of the noblest type, he saw in the
occupation of Frankfort in 1866, the advent at
once of militarism and of foreign rule. He
determined to abandon a town still dear to
him, but intolerable since it supported an
oppressor. Too just, however, to enforce this
decision upon his two sons, he gave them the
choice: he that remained should continue the
business subject to a half-charge upon all discount
and advances, the other might accompany
him to freedom and to England. David
elected, with reluctance, to accept the Prussian
domination; Mr I. Z. Barnett, the younger
son, departed with his father to this country,
to the no small delight of his mother, who intended,
if possible upon their arrival to renew
the family ties with Admiral Sir J. Cowen.</p>

<p>This legitimate purpose she did not live to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
fulfil. She died soon after her establishment
in London, and her husband did not long
survive her.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett has often pointed out to me the
little room in the Albany where he began his
long and difficult struggle with fortune. He
spent little, he lived laboriously; within ten
years he had accumulated a sufficient capital to
devise and launch the Haymarket Bank. The
scheme of this speculation, risked by a comparatively
poor man, yet in the early thirties,
should be enough to stamp the genius of its
creator. The Bank depended upon a principle
which, had it but proved successful, would
have revolutionised the financial world. All
depositors were paid interest yearly upon the
average of their current accounts at the rate of
eight per cent. At first it was difficult to persuade
a public wedded, wherever money was
concerned, to formal routine; but when, at the
end of the first year, the eight per cent. was
duly paid (for Mr Barnett would accept no
more than his original capital could meet),
timidity gave place to enthusiasm, for eighteen
months the institution increased as though by
magic. If ever the ordinary operations of the
bank failed, on occasion, to earn the stipulated
interest, fresh depositors could always be depended
on: their accounts furnished the funds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
necessary for the satisfaction of the yearly
dividend. These in turn received at the end
of twelve months, the eight per cent., which yet
another band of new investors had delightedly
furnished.</p>

<p>Upon lines so original and so daring,
a new system of banking seemed destined
to arise. No limit threatened the expansion
of the business, till a venomous article,
inspired perhaps wholly by political hatred,
suggested that the interest already paid could
only come out of the new capital daily furnished
to the concern. A panic followed this abominable
insinuation (the scoundrel had not the
courage to set it down for a fact), and within
twenty-four hours, the Haymarket Bank was
ruined.</p>

<p>Had Mr Barnett alone suffered by this underhand
attack, he would have felt it less; he was
still a young man and might retrieve his own
fortunes. But the thought of decent middle-class
ladies, of poor and struggling clergymen
ruined, not through their own fault, but because
they had trusted too thoroughly in him, was
more than he could bear. I have often heard
him speak of those painful days, and he has
never failed to point out that the same hands
which wantonly destroyed the Haymarket Bank
are responsible for the pestilent Little-Englandism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
which would (if it could) drag him down
from the great place he holds to-day. The
same spite that blasted the high promise of his
ambitions in pure finance, would—had it the
power—wither that climax of applied finance
which is but another word for Imperial endeavour:
but the M’Korio Delta and all it
means is now beyond the power of such
enemies.</p>

<p>For years Mr Barnett lay silent and obscure
under the stigma of this failure. He visited
Vienna, Constantinople, and Calcutta: he was
concerned with the Anatolian Railway extension:
it failed, and he again withdrew.
Passing through Cairo he enjoyed the simple
hospitality of the devout Harburys, and learnt
from the morning, noontide, and evening
prayers of that secluded household, a peace he
had not yet known. He attached the younger
Harbury to himself as secretary, and set out
with a higher heart to retrieve his fortunes.
He was instrumental in procuring a very
necessary sum of money for the Vidame de
Sorral: that nobleman, with the careless
generosity of his rank, disbursed a considerable
portion of his new found wealth upon a
yacht, wherein, overcoming a senseless and
unchristian repugnance, he took his benefactor
for a short cruise upon the African coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>It was in these circumstances that Mr I. Z.
Barnett, these few short years since, first set
eyes upon the land he was to render famous.</p>

<p>They were anchored off the western mouth
of the M’Korio. The morning was intensely
hot, without a breath of wind. The trees that
marked the swampy edge of the Delta shimmered
in a kind of mirage, and to the left, on
the high land some three miles away, a few
white dots marked the settlement and the
governor’s house.</p>

<p>How often has not Mr Barnett told the
story! His idle curiosity, the two days’
shooting which his host and he took in the
marshes, the slight fever, the British flag at
morning, and then suddenly, an inspiration
wholly new, the vision of what this place
was to be!</p>

<p>The yacht was welcome to sail without him—he
was closeted day after day with officials
and such travellers as were waiting for the
English mail. He travelled: in a fashion he
surveyed. He even obtained an interview
with the governor, who, sceptical as he is,
has recently confessed how impressed he was
with the enthusiasm of this strange man, and
has himself largely invested in the Company.
Mr Barnett was convinced—he knew not how:
it was a kind of faith—he was convinced of the
presence of gold. He saw the banks dyked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the marshes drained, a province immensely
fertile, teeming with wealth, standing at the
door of the vast M’Korio valley, the very key
of Africa: and all that for England!</p>

<p>He stayed as long as his health would
permit, Harbury by his side, meeting the
native chiefs, questioning old hunters, obtaining
options, and using such legitimate influence
as lay in his power with the local agent of
Reuter. Almost bereft of capital, he yet
secured some few concessions (for they were
thought worthless)—he so disposed them that
their sites commanded the best of the territory.
Above all, he learnt that the paltry trade of
the place, its reputation in the City, and in
some sense its economic future, were in the
hands of two men, two friends, a shipowner
and an importer of hardware. He learnt that
of all men they were most contemptuous
towards the M’Korio. He learnt that the
shipowner thought to know it more thoroughly
than any other man, and was not to be persuaded
of its great destiny: that the merchant,
who had never visited it, had for years driven
so weak a trade as to give him the smallest
opinion of its chances: that they were both
men old, hard in routine, and difficult. He
learnt their names. The shipowner was a Mr
Abbott; the name of Mr Abbott’s friend, the
hardware merchant, was Burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>He learnt that without them nothing could
be done: this he learnt thoroughly: this of all
the things most impressed him.</p>

<p>He returned to England, and for one year
or two he perfected his plans.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those who will deny the working of a conscious
Providence in human affairs, are led
into their errors through an inability to grasp
the complexity of the world around them.
They would have each good deed immediately
rewarded, and rewarded after its own kind;
they would have every evil punished in some
direct and manifest way, forgetting that such
a punishment would not complete the episode,
but would itself originate a chain of further
effects.</p>

<p>It is not thus that Immanent Justice informs
and balances the lives of men. But if we
observe a group of human activities for any
length of time, we discover a network of
reactions in which is soon manifest an astonishing
unity of design. This charity, that heroism
will bear far off, and in some wholly unexpected
portion of the scheme, a fruit which
is also its compensation; such and such a piece
of cruelty or weakness, seemingly unrequited,
may be traced through a succession of consequences,
ever creating of itself its own
retribution until at last it has paid, just where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the payment was most needed, the full debt
incurred to whatever governs the world.</p>

<p>This novel and illuminating thought, for
which I am indebted to Dr M’Manus’ “Persecution
of the Irish Protestants,” has thrown a
religious light over all the chief experiences of
my life. The learned divine exemplifies his
philosophy by references to James II. and the
history of his own romantic Belfast: I prove
its truth by a consideration of the only considerable
political movement with which I
have been brought into touch, I mean the
Development of the M’Korio Delta.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett, meeting Mr Harbury years
ago in his father’s quiet Oriental vicarage, had
recognised his talents, and had attached him
to his fortunes. It was an accident, but an
accident of kindness.</p>

<p>Mr Burden, my friend, acquired long ago,
with little thought of gain, the control of such
small trade as could be driven with the naked
and debased aborigines of a fetid African river.
It barely affected the considerable profits of
his business; he gave it little thought. It was
an accident, but that accident had in it a vein,
however slight, of patriotic motives destined in
time to yield, even in this life, a thousandfold.</p>

<p>Mrs Burden had ever desired that Cosmo
should be sent to the University. Before his
fifth birthday, she had discovered in her child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
aptitudes of no common order. His father
had nourished a secret design to put him at
once from school into the business; during his
wife’s last illness he had abandoned his own
will, and promised her that the boy should
enjoy the advantages she implored. That also
was an active, if a slight, example of self-denial
and of love.</p>

<p>Lastly, and most especially, Mr Harbury,
by one fine act of enlightened good nature,
had bound in gratitude the reserved and somewhat
difficult affections of the lad upon whom
so much depended.</p>

<p>Observe how great an issue lay in these
little things: these little and obscure good
deeds! What man save Mr Barnett had
understood, or could understand, the full
meaning of the M’Korio? What chances had
any vision of his against the opposition of all
that limited, monied, hard “good sense”
whereby Mr Burden despised the wealth latent
in the colony with which he alone traded?
And yet Mr Burden’s voice in this matter
would certainly lead the city! What ambassador
could have been found to persuade a
merchant of Mr Burden’s kind that the future
of a great province depended upon such a man
as Mr Barnett, whose character could not but
have affected him as alien, and perhaps as
repulsive?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Cosmo alone could bridge that gulf. His
lethargy, if I may use the term, would have
proved an insuperable obstacle, and all that
he had heard from his young associates of
“honour” would have confused his judgment,
had not that closer tie been created in a few
predestined hours by Mr Harbury’s trained,
courteous, and ready heart.</p>

<p>Each of us to-day in whatever way we have
immixed with that Imperial adventure as shareholders
or plain citizens; as preachers, journalists,
or perhaps in some sweet womanly way;
every soldier who has returned without stain
from the Delta; every administrator of every
grade, nay, every holder of every salaried office
in the M’Korio, owes something to that half
hour when so considerable a sum as £1250 was
lent without any kind of fee or troublesome
inquiry at a nominal rate of fifteen per cent. to
rescue a fellow-being from dishonour.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">In every tragedy connected with old age,
the hardening which is the curse of age
appears.</p>

<p>The picture which Mr Burden presented at
this moment is the more vivid in my memory
from the suddenness with which it was extinguished.
I desire to describe him as accurately
as I may for the sake of that posterity
which must learn, not only what his virtues
were, but also in what way, and through what
weakness, he failed upon the chief occasion of
his life. It is a lesson of the highest moment.</p>

<p>Tall, erect, somewhat pompous, but withal
very active in his carriage, he carried all the
remains of a strong manhood. Of his face I
can only say that it was typical of his class:
square with a large firm mouth kept closely
shut, and carrying, from long habit, an affectation
of purpose and determination which was
far from the habitual tenor of his mind. His
hair was quite white but abundant; he parted
it with care upon the left side, and brushed it
up clear from his forehead as befitted his sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
sense of what was decent in such things.
His eyebrows were contracted into a slight
mechanical frown, acquired perhaps in the
habit of attention, but certainly expressing no
anxiety nor even any particular keenness in
bargaining. His hands were remarkably
steady, his gestures firm and sure. I have
heard it said, with a colonial exaggeration,
that to see him open his umbrella was to comprehend
England from the Reform Bill to
Home Rule. The young gentleman who
composed this facile epigram, a student with
a nasal accent and weak in every organ, was
born and bred in Port Elizabeth, to which
distant centre of African loyalty he has returned.
Let me forget him and continue the
description of my friend.</p>

<p>His eyes, of a pale grey, were alight with so
singular an honesty as to border upon ignorance
of the world. He had perhaps never in
his life deceived a human being. His business,
founded upon ample capital, demanding no
credit, existing as a wholesale resource for the
trade and independent of advertisement, never
required it of him to lie, to cheat, to gamble,
or to destroy another’s wealth. Its expansion
had been automatic; if his success had raised
in him any evil, it was certainly nothing worse
than a slight tincture of pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Of his patriotism I fear to speak lest I
should destroy by too violent a praise the
impression I desire to produce. It was abundant,
it was like a perennial spring; it was the
deepest thing in the man. I am certain that
had England been in danger he would cheerfully
have sacrificed his fortune. He had
known nothing but his country; his very
religion was in some odd way muddled up
with her vices, her spirit, and the peculiar
beauties of her landscapes, the less obvious
effects of her towns. Indeed, he would have
died for her ... perhaps in a sense he <em>did</em>
die for her ... his name, manner, and habit
of life seemed to me who knew him to be
always England, England.</p>

<p>With all this there was a failing, which
neither I nor even those who were in more
daily intimacy with him, could hope to eradicate.
The national life, to which he was so deeply
attached, had stood still with him for many years.</p>

<p>Let me not be misunderstood. He had followed
with a certain eagerness the development
of England and of the Empire. He was an
assiduous reader of the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, <cite>The
Gleam</cite>, <cite>The Orb</cite>, <cite>The Globe</cite>, <cite>The Times</cite>, and
<cite>The Meteor</cite>; he received <cite>The Spectator</cite>, <cite>The
Economist</cite>, <cite>The Doctrinaire</cite> upon every Saturday
morning, and occasionally looked at them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
and when he went abroad, according to his
custom, during the month of August, he was
careful to make such arrangements as caused
these standard weekly organs of opinion to
reach him not later than the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>The mere facts, therefore, he knew. He was
gratified, and occasionally enthusiastic, over the
expansion of our dominion. He had a grasp
of the various stages by which the jealousy of
foreign nations had been stilled, and their competition
annulled. He had appreciated in latter
years the decline of English commerce, the ruin
of our agriculture, and the upbuilding of a
Greater Britain beyond the seas.</p>

<p>All the manifest destiny of the Anglo-Saxon
race he had seen as clearly as the humblest
clerk; he had received it with as religious an
emotion as had the poorest and most vulgar of
our electorate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless all this had been for him but a
pageant. He had never comprehended the
great change in our method of thought which
this new fact in the life of the world involved.
He was like a man who hears of this or that
catastrophe—of this or that triumph, suffers in
the catastrophe or glories in the triumph, but
suffers and glories as in a thing apart: a thing
read or seen upon the stage. He never really
got it into his mind that <em>he</em> was an actor in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
drama; that <em>he</em>, as a citizen, was making the
new world.</p>

<p>It is a paradox, but a paradox ever present
in our contemporary life; we owe to it the
extreme reluctance with which each new and
necessary idea is accepted by a people born,
after all, to Empire. It is in our blood.</p>

<p>Did space permit me, I could give many
instances of this failing: let me be content with
two. Mr Burden had voted honourably and
straightforwardly for that small taxation of our
food supplies, which was necessary for the consolidation
of the Empire. Of the direct effect
of that vote he never complained; but he would
not or could not connect with his opinion upon
this matter, the necessary depreciation which
it involved in his investments. Again, he had
read and applauded Mr Chamberlain’s great
speech just after the Australian Commonwealth
cancelled the “loans previous”; he also appreciated
that Australia must have new capital,
and that, in the actual state of her credit, this
capital could only come from Great Britain;
yet in the meeting in the Cannon Street Hotel
six months later, he had described the reconstruction
of the Waga-Murri mine as
“un-English.”</p>

<p>Mr Burden’s dissociation from the underlying
philosophy of his time went deeper still.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
He would have maintained, in a kind of abstract
way, that the connection between finance and
politics was dangerous—it is difficult to say
whether he saw that it was necessary. At any
rate he dreaded and avoided that necessity.
He would have admitted that a Cabinet drawn
from the ranks of rich men was a purer and
better government than one formed upon the
less stable models of democratic nations, but in
some vague way he must have thought of their
wealth as exclusively territorial, for he would not
only have expressed, but would have felt a
very genuine horror at hearing that a Cabinet
minister had held, or had been given, such and
such shares in a company connected with our
Imperial development.</p>

<p>When he was asked, as I once asked him,
how a man could be rich and yet not mixed up
with the principal source of modern wealth in
England, he replied with a simple affirmation;
he said that any one in office should sell whatever
shares he had possessed in such concerns.
He refused to follow the logical consequences
of his creed.</p>

<p>It was precisely upon this point that a greater
mind, a mind more necessary to England,
though not perhaps more English, found the
principal difficulty of contact. Mr Barnett knew
that the M’Korio Delta was a touchstone for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the future of England. I do not pretend that
his only motive lay there. His motives were
largely economic. But, at anyrate, the fulfilment
of his own legitimate ambition demanded
that he should persuade English opinion of
what the M’Korio Delta was.</p>

<p>As I have repeatedly pointed out, there was
not at that time in the city any name whose
influence would have a more immediate effect
towards converting the investor in W. African
securities than that of Mr Burden; and yet
every avenue of Mr Burden’s mind was closed
to such methods of approach as Mr Barnett
comprehended. He could not offer shares, and
that sharp imaginative power which would have
turned the M’Korio Delta into the great province
it must become in the future, he knew
that Mr Burden did not and could not possess.</p>

<p>The very circumstances by which Mr Burden
came to be the sole arbiter (as it were) of
M’Korian trade made Mr Barnett’s advance
the more difficult.</p>

<p>Charles Abbott, who by a curious anachronism,
remains to this day the chief proprietor
of the Abbott Line of steamers, had
(and has) about him something of the explosive
radicalism which was often to be discovered in
the older sort of English officials and business
men; the men who helped, in their unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
way, to build that which we now direct towards
such astounding destinies. Of the New Empire
he had a shallow, but a curiously robust
disgust. He loved things as he had seen
them—as they were: for dreams, for anticipations,
he had as profound a contempt as for
debt. He had never owed any man a farthing;
he had never done business with the future.
In feature he was red and a little over-eager;
in gestures abrupt and strong; but his violence
was balanced by a deep and emphatic voice
which possessed a strange power of persuasion,
especially over men less hearty than himself.</p>

<p>Such a man had not founded his fleet of
ships to deal with “niggers.” He had developed
it upon the South American trade. A Government
subsidy had persuaded him to touch once
a month at the M’Korio. He had travelled
there once in person, and had carried away
nothing but an added contempt for the policy
that could deal with such things. Through
this unsympathetic channel had Mr Burden
been introduced to the Delta.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott, though ten years Mr Burden’s
junior, had been, almost from boyhood, his
most intimate friend; it was an intimacy born
of perpetual daily association, meals in common,
and a long life spent with few other opportunities
for expansion than that afforded by each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
other’s society. When he had last returned to
Europe from a voyage to the Delta he had
suggested to Mr Burden—with no great enthusiasm—that
there was some little dealing
to be had with the aborigines of that marsh, in
goods of the sort that Mr Burden handled.
Iron rings of a sort known to the trade as
“Large Nines,” were in that district not only a
rarity but an object of political necessity.
Long the symbol of authority upon the heads
of the chiefs, they had been manufactured with
infinite pains from old ship nails by the natives,
or imported at considerable expense from the
neighbouring Sultanate of Botu. Our excellent
English article, cheaper, more reliable, and
more accurately made, soon settled the competition
of these rivals. It was impossible,
indeed, to accept as currency the valuable
slaves which had formerly found their way to
the Sultanate; but considerable quantities of
ivory were obtainable for many years in exchange
for a gross of these goods; and Mr
Burden had the advantage not only of securing
such a profit as was due to his initiative and
skill, but of knowing that indirectly through
his efforts, the slave trade had disappeared in a
part of Africa where it had seemed inseparable
from the soil.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that this state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
things should last for ever. Oligarchic as was
the nature of M’Korian society, the number of
chiefs was limited; and a religious awe forbade
the possession by anyone of more than a certain
number of these sacred symbols. Moreover,
a German firm, secretly subsidised by
its government, had so far interfered with
the old monopoly as to offer the rings at a
price which made it difficult for the original
trade to subsist in English hands. But Mr
Burden’s profits were soon supplemented from
other sources. Guns, of a simple sort, and a
kind of sword, were introduced, and (a very
remarkable example of the ingenuity of a client
in Birmingham) fine chain armour replaced the
leathern jackets which the warriors of the protectorate
had hitherto worn.</p>

<p>But, though Mr Burden had become the
sole importer, though his advice and that of
Mr Abbott often controlled the decision of
the Government in the local affairs of the
M’Korio, and though his name was attached
to all the few traditions of the settlement,
yet the trade was very small, and, such as it
was, it was dwindling. In Mr Burden’s considerable
affairs, the total of this petty offshoot
did not amount to one-twentieth at the most;
it rarely represented a profit of £400—more
commonly less than £300 in a year; and, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
his natural compliance in Charles Abbott’s
judgment, therefore, was added a business experience
which made of the Delta something
mean and paltry in his conception.</p>

<p>This contempt of his for the M’Korio was
broken down at last by the intervention of
Cosmo; but that intervention, necessary as it
was in its moment, would not alone have
sufficed, though without it nothing would finally
have been done.</p>

<p>The ground had first to be prepared for the
whole public and for Mr Burden as a part of
that public; and the instrument of this preparation
was the power which—a full year before
he had met Mr Burden’s son—Mr Barnett
had begun to exercise over the Press.</p>

<p>There is a kind of rash political indignation
which we all come across, and to which some
of us are attracted. There are men who hate
the successful or the rich, but whose hatred is
not quite dishonest, though it is wildly unjust.
They see conspiracies upon every side, they
scowl at every new fortune, but they do so in
good faith, for they are haunted by a nightmare
of Cosmopolitan Finance—pitiless, destructive
of all national ideals, obscene, and
eating out the heart of our European tradition.
I need hardly say that this kind of hatred was
roused against Mr Barnett, and gained an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
especial strength from the attitude which the
great papers took towards what was known to
be his scheme; and yet at that moment Mr
Barnett, had the world known it, was comparatively
poor. He had not certainly a free
capital of ten thousand pounds, beyond what
was locked up in his various properties and
adventures.</p>

<p>The particular charge made against Mr
Barnett was that he had “bought the Press”—or
at least the London Press.</p>

<p>Of general and vaguer charges there were
many, but they are incapable of proof, and I
shall not concern myself with them. With his
relations towards the Press I am well acquainted;
and though it is not my business to
defend Mr Barnett, yet I am so convinced
that this kind of indignation proceeds solely
from an ignorance of our social machinery,
that it is incumbent upon me to show quite
clearly how false the accusation was.</p>

<p>The men who made it (a salutary fear of the
law of libel forbade them as a rule to put it
into print), the men who made it, I say, had no
other ground than this: they saw that the
M’Korio Delta was in the air, they heard the
name upon every side; they knew that Mr
Barnett would necessarily grow rich upon its
development; they saw the Press almost unanimous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
in its demand for that development, and
they jumped to the false conclusion which I have
indicated, because their vision had been warped
by an uncontrolled and ill-balanced anger against
the modern inequalities of fortune.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett had not bought the Press; the
Press is not to be bought. That Mr Barnett had
an influence with the Press, and a legitimate
influence, I will not deny; but when I have
described that influence I think my thesis will
be proved.</p>

<p>Let us consider first what papers Mr Barnett
owned. Here is the list. He was the proprietor
of <cite>Little Ones</cite>, <cite>Boy’s Chatter</cite>, <cite>The Woman</cite>,
<cite>The English Country Side</cite>. For some months,
in the interval between the bankruptcy of Sir
Charles Binsted and the formation of the
Agricultural Union, he had also owned the
<cite>Farmer’s Friend</cite>. It is incredible that he
should have made such purchases with any
object of hoodwinking public opinion. He
could only have made them as an investment.
The very names of the papers are sufficient
proof of this.</p>

<p>Beyond these he was proprietor of <cite>The
Review</cite>. <cite>The Review</cite> was a losing property;
he had been compelled to assume direction of
it in payment of a debt, and he was occupied
at the date of which I speak in building it up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
into something of its former importance. He
was also part owner (but only part owner), of
the rival <cite>Holborn Review</cite>, and the editor, who
had been for some time his private secretary,
has assured me that Mr Barnett’s name was
hardly mentioned in the office. I am confident
that he took no interest whatsoever in
the <cite>Holborn Review</cite>, save as a financial venture.
My readers have but to turn to a file to see that
arguments upon both sides were admitted to
its pages, and that the M’Korio Delta, even at
the height of its fame, rarely afforded matter
for more than one article in each issue.</p>

<p>Lest I should be accused of concealing anything
that might militate against my contention,
I will mention the fact that Mr Barnett did
own the majority of the shares of the Twentieth
Century Syndicate. Now the Twentieth Century
Syndicate, it is true, finances the Railton
Group; but Mr Barnett himself had nothing
to do with that group. It is interested in <cite>The
Mercury</cite>, <cite>The Britisher</cite>, <cite>The Hammer</cite>, and
the two evening papers, <cite>England</cite> and <cite>The
Empire</cite>. No one who is acquainted with the
nature of modern finance can believe for a
moment that so indirect a relation would give
Mr Barnett the least voice in the management
of these sheets.</p>

<p>Whether Mr Barnett held shares in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
London and General Publishing Company at
any one time, it is not easy to determine. These
shares fluctuated considerably, and, if one may
say so without disrespect to so honoured a
name as that of the Duke of Essex, the chairman
of the Company, they were something of
a gambling stock. They were perpetually
changing hands, and the motive of their
acquisition, whether by Mr Barnett or by anyone
else, cannot have been other than that of
a speculative game.</p>

<p>Over the great dailies he had absolutely no
control whatsoever. He advertised in them, of
course; and a good deal of capital was made
by his opponents out of the fact that Mr
Jefferson, the owner and editor of so important
a sheet as <cite>The Gazette</cite>, was connected with
Mr Barnett in the old business of the Haymarket
Bank; but if that is to be taken as
an evidence of corruption, or even of undue
influence, who would be safe from such an
accusation?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A man in his position is naturally
acquainted, often intimate, with the leading
men of his time. The editor of <cite>The
Doctrinaire</cite>—a man wholly above suspicion—was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
proud of his intimate friendship; and he
naturally had relations as a host upon more than
one occasion with the two proprietors of <cite>The
Nation</cite>, and with the editors or owners of most
of the other great dailies. But Mr Barnett
had no monopoly in such acquaintances or
friendships; most of our great financiers could
have boasted of the same.</p>

<p>It is time that I should turn from the ungrateful
task of defending a man against a
calumny that ought never to have been
made, to describe the real services which
Mr Barnett rendered to his adopted country,
and to the Empire; nowhere were these
services more apparent than in the interest
he took in the careers of the more brilliant
young journalists. Let me cite the case of
Mr Powler.</p>

<p>Mr Powler had been among the first to see
the advantages of reversing our fiscal policy.
As long ago as 1898, just after taking his
degree, he had written a powerful defence of
Protection which had earned him his Fellowship.
He was poor, and the whole weight of
his genius might have been lost for years to
England had not Mr Barnett appointed him
to the editorship of <cite>The Review</cite>, just before
the outbreak of the war in South Africa. No
one is ignorant of the effect of that appointment.</p>

SOUTH AFRICA,” TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Long after the war was over, but a full year
before any mention of the M’Korio Delta had
been publicly made, the editor of <cite>The Doctrinaire</cite>—a
man wholly above suspicion—wrote
to Mr Barnett, and asked him if he could
recommend some young fellow to sub-edit that
great weekly journal during his own enforced
absence upon a shooting party in Scotland.
I know from Mr Powler himself what passed.
Mr Barnett came in person to the office of
<cite>The Review</cite>, climbed to the third story (no
small sacrifice in a man of his temperament
and figure!) and begged Mr Powler to accept
the post.</p>

<p>“It is better paid,” he said, “and a bigger
place altogether than anything that I could
offer you.” Then he added with a smile:
“You know the advice that I always give to
you young men.”</p>

<p>It was in vain that Mr Powler (so he himself
assures me), pleaded to remain in the service
of a man whom he could not but regard as the
builder of a new world. He knew that Mr
Barnett was making a great sacrifice in permitting
him to go, and it was only after a generous
dispute that the older man had his way.</p>

<p>Mr Powler took with him to <cite>The Doctrinaire</cite>
Mr Heinrich Rallé, and between them they
gave a life and a meaning to the paper which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
recalled the great days of John Hardy and the
successful, strenuous battle in favour of the
unification of Italy in the sixties. When the
editor of <cite>The Doctrinaire</cite> returned from Scotland,
he found the beginnings of a fortune;
and it seems to me not unnatural that he should,
under the circumstances, have permitted something
of a new policy to appear in his pages,
or that he should have been drawn towards
Mr Barnett with a sentiment approaching to
affection.</p>

<p>Talent of this kind is rare in modern journalism.
The proprietors of <cite>The Nation</cite> privately
approached and obtained the services of Mr
Henry Rallé. I will not enter into the somewhat
heated difference that arose between
<cite>The Doctrinaire</cite> and <cite>The Nation</cite> relative to
this matter. I will content myself with saying
that Mr Raleigh infused a new life into the latter
paper, erased from its outer cover the phrase
“an Hebdomadal Journal,” permitted the insertion
of illustrations, and in the general tone
he imparted to its articles made it what it had
never been before; a vigorous ally of all that
makes for the larger life of England. It was
on this occasion that Mr Barnett’s friendship
with Mr Jenkins, a proprietor of <cite>The Nation</cite>,
arose; and it is a singular example of his tact
and care for detail, that, during the four or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
five years which have since elapsed, in all the
multitude of dinners that either have eaten
under Mr Barnett’s roof, Mr Jenkins and the
editor of <cite>The Doctrinaire</cite> have never met.</p>

<p>I will not weary my readers with the story
of the founding of <cite>Criticism</cite>; of the resuscitation
of the old <cite>Orb</cite>, or of that vigorous off-shoot
of Colonial enterprise, the London edition of
the <cite>M’Korio Times</cite>, It is enough to say
that, in all this mass of ephemeral literature,
the last journal alone was directly founded by
Mr Barnett; and, as it dealt principally with
the City, it had but little effect upon the general
current of opinion.</p>

<p>All this intellectual movement was instinct
with the spirit of England.</p>

<p>There are political forces that seem without
form, very vague and viewless as great currents
of air may be, but they are as irresistible.</p>

<p>Through England and the English some
such force has long been stirring. All these
young men had felt it; all were bound as by
a kind of fate to express it. It coloured their
writing upon every topic. It troubled their
view of the future; it compelled them to continual
appeals. For long that undefined and
natural thing, that impulse of patriotism, had
wandered in vagaries, thinking that now here,
now there, it had found the substance which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
should inspire, the matter which it was destined
to make live. So all great movements begin.</p>

<p>At last, and not long after the advent into
English journalism of that younger life and
keener enthusiasm which I have just described,
a true and permanent object absorbed its
energies, and, if one may use the phrase, the
nation and her servants had found their mission.</p>

<p>The full meaning of the M’Korio Delta had
appeared.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">In the first few months after his success in
the University examinations, Cosmo lived
a life which should have proved a fitting introduction
to the position his father had reserved
for him.</p>

<p>With the middle of October he entered the
business in Thames Street, and displayed an
assiduity delightful for Mr Burden to witness.</p>

<p>The merchant was, indeed, astonished at the
aptitude, or, perhaps, the inherited commercial
talent, which had survived his son’s philological
training, and was at times prepared to admit
that the study of modern languages, even upon
the side of pure literature, served (as he had
often heard from its defenders) for a gymnastic
to the growing mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young man was far from forgetting
the pleasures due to his rank; but he
used them in such a way that the development
of his character was in no way injured. His
health forbade excess. His acquaintances ensured,
some that his pleasures should be refined,
others that they should be energetic, all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
they should be well selected. In a word he
led, during the happy winter months that followed,
the normal life of that class which is
perhaps the soundest, as it is certainly the most
many-sided in Europe—the class which has
learnt to govern an immeasurable realm without
corruption, and almost without ambition.</p>

<p>It was remarkable that, in spite of his prospects,
he maintained a severe grasp over his
private expenditure, and this wise economy
helped still further to strengthen a character
which might, at first, have shown signs of weakness.
He managed to do thoroughly well
without a private trap, replacing it by such
cabs as his business or amusements demanded.
As for riding, one horse sufficed him, and when
he visited the country to hunt (as he would
occasionally do in the middle of a business
week), he was not above jobbing a mount from
a local stable; he would not be at the expense
of hunters. Did he visit the theatre, the stalls
seemed to him his most natural place. He
took a box but twice during the whole of that
autumn, once when the house was full, and on
another occasion when he had calculated that
the number of friends whom he could accommodate
in this manner would have cost a trifle
more had he taken them to separate seats.</p>

<p>At the Empire, the Alhambra, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
music halls he made it a rule to break a sovereign
as he entered, and to make that sum
suffice him for the whole evening.</p>

<p>He but rarely visited the Savoy, the Carlton,
or Prince’s. When he entertained it was at
his club, and though he was careful that the
wine and cooking should be of the best, yet
he abhorred the ostentation of unseasonable
flowers, and of vintages whose names might
be unfamiliar to his guests. His dress was
nearly always new, and always, always quiet.
His linen fitted him with exactitude (a result
of careful measurement). To his hats he paid
that attention which is only to be discovered
in men who comprehend the subtle importance
of those ornaments.</p>

<p>In everything the management of his affairs
displayed a wise reticence and balance; qualities
most fortunately bestowed upon him by Providence,
when we consider that his father’s old-fashioned
standard forbade him an allowance of
more than £250 a year.</p>

<p>His life, I say, through all that winter, was
at once well-ordered and happy, and justly
envied by his contemporaries. There was
but one flaw in the perfection of his content,
and that flaw was to be discovered in the very
serious condition of his finances.</p>

<p>The interest upon £1250—an interest to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
paid half-yearly—even if it be at so small a rate
as 15 per cent., may appear at the time of payment
a sum of astonishing magnitude to the
needy. It amounts, as the less classical of my
readers will at once perceive, to no less than
£93, 15s. at the end of every six months; and
when the first of these terms approached him
in the course of February, Cosmo had the misfortune
to find himself for the moment unable
to meet it.</p>

<p>I have already indicated to what an exaggerated
extent he permitted such little matters to
prey upon his mind. I need hardly say that in
his distress he went to call upon Mr Harbury.</p>

<p>That excellent friend spoke to him more
seriously than he had done upon the first
occasion. He pointed out to him that, while
debts of the more ordinary sort were often a
matter for jest, the exact payment of interest
was a duty upon the fulfilment of which a man’s
honour was engaged. In a somewhat softer
manner, Mr Harbury proceeded to inform
Cosmo of the concern which Mr Barnett had
begun to take in his career; nor did he conceal
from him that, on hearing of his difficulty, the
very first thing he had done had been to write
to that large-hearted and widely-travelled man
whom he (Mr Harbury) regarded almost in
the light of a father. Rising at the close of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
this conversation, he laid his hand, not without
dignity, upon the young man’s shoulder, and
begged him to dismiss all further thought of
the matter from his mind.... It would have
been evident to a meaner intelligence than that
of Mr Burden’s son, that he had once more
been saved by agencies whose power he had
long admired, and whose character he had
begun to revere.</p>

<p>From that moment he threw himself with a
kind of zeal into the companionship of such
friends. The ensuing spring was largely passed
in their society. Gratitude alone would have
compelled him to frequent their houses: to
gratitude, admiration was added, and to admiration
a sudden access of a sense of familiarity,
when he discovered that no less a person than
Charles Benthorpe was very often a fellow
guest with himself.</p>

<p>The historic name which this young man
bore so easily; the consummate knowledge of
the world which he had acquired as the companion
of his father’s official life, the public
reputation of the family, and to some extent
the titular honour it boasted, had drawn Cosmo
warmly towards the enjoyment of Charles Benthorpe’s
friendship, during their contemporary
residence at the University.</p>

<p>Nay more, Lord Benthorpe himself, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Cosmo discovered with astonishment and
pleasure, was, in a manner, the familiar of
these few who had at heart the glory of
England in the delta of the great African
river. Often as the name M’Korio would
enter into the conversation, still more often
would the experience, and occasionally the
name, of Lord Benthorpe accompany the
judgment of Mr Harbury, of Mr Barnett, and
of that Major Pondo, whom it will be my
business upon a later page to describe. Charles
Benthorpe, in spite of the reserve which properly
accompanies exalted social rank, was not
unwilling to describe his father’s attitude upon
those Imperial matters whereof that statesman’s
long political and administrative experience
had given him an exhaustive knowledge.</p>

<p>Nor was it only the name and opinions of
Lord Benthorpe that mingled with their discussions.
Once his lordship came in person
to a dinner of Mr Barnett’s, and was willing to
express by word of mouth his strong faith in the
future of the M’Korio Delta. Upon another
occasion, Mr Harbury was able to read a letter
from him, regretting the peer’s inability to
address a small private meeting upon the
potentialities of the M’Korio, potentialities
which, in his absence, were set forth by that
Major Pondo, with whom, as I have just remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
and shall probably remark again, a
future page must deal.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Were it my task (which I thank Heaven it
is not) to compose a work of fiction, I should
attempt to exclude all persons and scenes
irrelevant to the simple current of my story.
The more suitable, but I fear less entertaining,
relation upon which I am engaged permits no
such artistic selection: I am compelled to
describe all those who in any principal way
entered the last days of Mr Burden’s life, and,
delicate as is the business of portraying a
living peer and politician, it is my duty to
present (with all the reticence and courtesy
due to such a figure) the character of Lord
Benthorpe.</p>

<p>To this end I must first sketch, in the most
summary manner, that distinguished family
history upon which depends no small part of
the affection and esteem in which all Englishmen
delight to hold him.</p>

<p>A subtle admixture of talent and inherited
rank is to-day more than ever the strength of
our folk. Nor do I fear to offend the modern
taste by printing here the typical record of
a great line.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe’s family is first heard of
more than a century ago. His grandfather,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
John Calvin Benthorpe was, at the close of
December 1796,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a young solicitor<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in the town
of Dublin. In the very next year we find him
put into the Irish Parliament by the Duke of
Meath as a recognition of his strong sympathy
with the national aspirations of the time, and,
Presbyterian as he was, with the legitimate
demands for religious emancipation preferred
by the bulk of his fellow-citizens: co-religionists
of his Grace.</p>

<p>His fine talents and excellent appreciation
of men soon won him a political position independent
of his early patron; and he had the
good fortune to be instrumental, both as a
principal and as a shrewd negotiator, in the
passing of the Act of Union. He had indeed
permitted himself certain rhetorical exercises
against that measure in debate; but, in the
hard practical matter of voting, his inheritance
of Scotch common-sense had outweighed his
Irish enthusiasm, and he soon found himself in
a position to purchase an estate in Wiltshire,
some fifteen miles to the north-east of Old
Sarum.</p>

<p>A character too weighty, and perhaps too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
sincerely Christian, to feel in middle age the
continued attraction of political life, he applied
himself rather to the founding of a family
worthy of the title which His Majesty
King George III. had, at the respectful
entreaty of Mr Pitt, conferred upon him.</p>

<p>With this object, he considered for some
years the contracting of a suitable marriage,
and, after a deliberation whose purpose he
was far too chivalrous to conceal, he decided
to honour from among many, and to lead to
the altar, the charming Laetitia Green, only
child of Mr Groen, senior partner in the well-known
banking firm of Strong-i’-th’-arm and
Hurst.</p>

<p>His wife’s and his own remaining fortune he
sank in further purchases of land, and in the
erection of a very fine mansion in the Debased
Palladian manner. This great house (to
which its owner first attached the name of
Placton) is not only famous with most educated
men, but will also be familiar to the general
reader from its frequent appearance in the
Memoirs of Lady Graftham, and in the Life
of Mr Groen, recently published by his nephew,
Lord Hurst of Hatton.</p>

<p>George Patrick Frederick-Culson Delamaine,
the fruit of this marriage, was born in
1823, at a moment when his father, the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Lord Benthorpe, was at the zenith of his
career as a land-owner. All the gifts of
fortune seemed to have been showered upon
the boy; his youth was leading to a manhood
of the most brilliant promise, when, at the age
of twenty-two, romance or folly led him into
an alliance with a woman hopelessly beneath
him in station.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of some local lawyer
or other, and so betrayed, in every accent and
gesture, the restrictions of her upbringing, as
to be incapable of that moulding influence
which her father-in-law’s family had hoped to
exercise. Her rare visits to Placton grew to
be an increasing embarrassment for the spacious
dignity of the household, and it was perhaps
but a merciful intervention of Providence when
she was left a widow in June 1852, as the result
of her husband walking inadvertently into the
well of a lift: a new invention, to which the
upper classes were as yet unaccustomed.</p>

<p>He left two children: Mary, born in February
1847, and Albert Delamaine (the present
Lord Benthorpe) born in July 1849.</p>

<p>To these children the old man showed a
peculiar and a noble devotion. He paid the
mother a yearly allowance of no less than
£400, on the strict condition that she should
live out of England, and enter into no communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
with the family. He was even at
the charge of employing private agents to see
that this condition was observed.</p>

<p>In the choice of their occupations, their servants,
their expenses, their very lap-dogs, nay,
their governesses and tutors, he directed himself
to the single object of making the boy and
girl that which their high station would later
require them to be; dying in 1858, he left his
task as a sacred legacy to his wife, the children’s
grandmother, who kept in view, with
admirable firmness, that ideal of ancient lineage
which her husband had so constantly cherished.</p>

<p>Not that any hint of their coming responsibility
was permitted to enter the children’s
fresh young minds. Mary, until her seventeenth
birthday, dressed upon less than a
hundred a year; rode out attended by a
groom in the plainest livery; and was permitted
upon no occasion, save that of indisposition,
to absent herself from morning
prayers. Albert was thrust willy-nilly into the
rough and tumble of public school life, and
discovered, in the rude manliness of Eton, just
what was needed to correct a somewhat oversensitive
temperament.</p>

<p>In a word, the first Lord Benthorpe had
proved characteristically successful in this his
last and (as it proved) posthumous task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>His wife lived to purchase her grandchild
his commission in a cavalry regiment, and to
see the second Lord Benthorpe attain his
majority amid those plaudits which the tenants
of Placton loyally reserved for a family to which
they owe their material and moral prosperity.</p>

<p>As a soldier, young Lord Benthorpe, though
quiet to a fault, proved deservedly popular.
His entertainments, which were numerous,
were marked by an absolute refinement, and,
if he exceeded in expense, it was through no
leaning towards ostentation, but rather from
the natural desire of a rich and reserved young
man to gather, by the sole means in his power,
a number of acquaintance.</p>

<p>He was sincerely glad when his regiment
was ordered abroad; he saw active service in
the Seychelles, he received in person the surrender
of seventeen half-breeds of Princess
Martha’s Own during the great mutiny of 1872,
and was mentioned in despatches. His wound
in the fleshy part of the leg, received during
the dreadful affair at Pútti-Ghâl, is a matter so
generally known that I need hardly allude to
it, save to remind my readers that the incident
is the subject of a fine steel engraving of
Hogge’s now sold in its original state by Messrs
Washington for the price of 21s., though soiled
copies are obtainable at a considerable reduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1875, when
he was but twenty-six years old, he thought
it his duty to sever his connection with the
army and to enter politics. To this piece of
self-sacrifice must be ascribed, I fear, all the
future misfortunes of his life.</p>

<p>He married.</p>

<p>Warned, I do not say by his father’s example,
but doubtless by some instinct, he took to wife
the Lady Arabella Hunt, of an age not far
distant from his own, of descent a trifle
superior, of a fortune which permitted him—I
fear imprudently—to rebuild the stables.</p>

<p>Such of my readers as may find their lot
cast upon the clayey, the calcareous, or the
oolitic soils of our beloved country, will appreciate
what I mean, when I allude to the agricultural
depression which afflicted the years
immediately subsequent to his marriage.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe, like so many others of his
ancient station, refused to believe that the star
of England had set. He was too generous to
reduce his splendid hospitality; too patriotic
to admit that the country and he could go
otherwise than forward; too proud of his
superb lineage to regret the investments in
arable land, pasture, undergrowth, common,
waste and marsh, which his forefathers had
made. He did indeed attempt to develop a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
small town in his neighbourhood which boasted
a medicinal well. He bought certain freeholds
within the borough, and the medical
profession were enthusiastic in their praise of
the waters. The less healthy of the governing
classes began to drink them in increasing
numbers; but that fatality which seemed to
dog his every effort caused an epidemic of
acute colic to coincide with the second year of
his effort, and he lost upon this chivalrous
venture the considerable sum of two hundred
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>He borrowed.</p>

<p>At first, for his daily needs, from local
banks; later, to repay their claims and to set
himself afloat again, from the more imposing
corporations of the metropolis; from these he received
such aid as he imagined would carry him
forward to a better day. But that day tarried.</p>

<p>He maintained his rents with difficulty. He
attempted to increase them. He lost the
affection of his tenants, a disaster for which
the remaining respect of his equals scarcely
compensated him. He was finally compelled
to abandon, most reluctantly, the society of
public entertainers, political, literary and racing
men, to which all his early manhood had
rendered him familiar. He grew to inviting
to Placton none but those to whom no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
other hospitality offered. When these failed
him, he fell back upon his relatives; when
these, upon the local clergy, the smaller squires—the
very doctors of his country town. It
was of no avail!</p>

<p>The government of Lord Beaconsfield, ever
solicitous for the honour of an ancient name,
did all that could be done. He was offered
posts well suited to his talents; he was eagerly
welcomed back to public life. Indeed, it was
his public work during the first years of his
difficulties—the last of the Conservative
cabinet—which has rendered his name so
familiar to all of us. How young he was in those
brave days! How admirably did he support,
and with what courage, the singular place
Great Britain vaunted in that better time!</p>

<p>I may be excused some enthusiasm as I recall
his speech at Salisbury upon “Peace with
Honour,” his piloting of the Laundry Bill
through the House of Lords, his contribution
to the Party funds during the Midlothian campaign,
a contribution which I know from
personal evidence to have been made possible
only by the courtesy of the present Marquis of
Bramber, then better known as “Jim.”</p>

<p>Certainly he loved his country. It is to the
honour of our party system that the Liberal
Ministry of the eighties did not misunderstand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
a patriotism of this calibre. He was sent to
Raub, to the Marranagoes, to Pilgrim’s Island:
positions which the routine of our Permanent
Service will not permit to be highly paid,
but which should normally offer ample opportunities
for experience. This experience he
acquired—but, alas! unfruitfully. Nothing he
touched succeeded. On his return to England
after an absence of three years, he abandoned
his official work that he might be freer to
retrieve his fortunes. His connection with
Colonial Government should have aided him
in the financial development of our dependencies.
His advice was, indeed, solicited by the
promoters of companies, but it proved almost
invariably unfortunate.</p>

<p>True to the straight line of honour in which
he had been brought up, he refused to be
mentioned publicly in connection with the
Raub Central, the Marranagoes Guanos, or the
Pilgrim’s Island Oil Syndicate. They all went
down; but, through that mysterious bond which
permits the outer public to scent out, as it were,
whatever the City privately honours, his reputation,
already great with experts, became general
when he permitted his name to stand at the
head of the Carria Canal Company. It is no
small testimony to the probity of our public
life that he benefited in no way from the rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
success of that enterprise. He was paid an
honest salary—a small salary; he demanded
no more. It pushed his name to the very
front rank of our Builders of Empire. I
would it had done more. It failed.</p>

<p>Lady Benthorpe held the helm meanwhile
unflinchingly in her large grasp. She was of
that kind which old Sutter finely calls “strong
women of the Lord”; of that kind which devised
the motto: “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sum: nihil humanum
a me alienum puto.</i>” To the last she kept an
open political drawing-room, of considerable if
decreasing account with the literary and professional
classes, using for that purpose in
winter the town house of her sister, but during
the season the large room of the Progress
Galleries, to the left—on the first landing.</p>

<p>Most women, under such a strain, would
have abandoned the struggle. Many would
have demanded the adventitious aid of stimulating
drugs. Her pride disdained it.</p>

<p>She sought the relief of which she stood in
need, from wines of the more hygienic sort,
especially the lighter sparkling wines so
strongly recommended by the Faculty; and
even to such medicine she forebore to have
recourse until the years of decline, when the
frail body could no longer support the indomitable
soul within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Her doctor was fully cognisant of her need.
He has assured me that the last sad months
owed their tragedy to nothing more than the
exhaustion of that admirable brain.</p>

<p>To the very end she was occasionally present
at her husband’s table, though her conversation
was no longer of the sobriety which once lent
a special distinction to that board; and when
Lord Benthorpe found it necessary in 1886 to
step once more upon the platform in defence
of the integrity of the Empire—or, as it was
then called, the Kingdom—she accompanied
him several times. It was with difficulty that
she was persuaded to abandon her design to
appear at the great meeting in the Albert Hall.</p>

<p>She died in February 1887, at the early age
of forty-one years, three months and two days.</p>

<p>Her end, though clouded by the most
grievous nervous trouble, was comforted and
enlightened by the presence of two beings
whom it would be ignoble to dismiss from this
record without a passing mention: Mr Warner,
the amiable scholar, to whom (as his former
tutor) Lord Benthorpe had presented the living
of Great Monckton, at the very gates of the
park, and his wife, Mrs Warner, whose wonderful
little book, “Hours of Healing” wafted
the spirit of the dying peeress from earth to
heaven.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that the difficulty of
pronouncing the aspirates in the title of this

letters. I am not competent to adjudge upon
this criticism; but, if it be well found, I may
at least point out the marvel of a faith which

and infuse so exalted a quality into the
prose of an untried pen.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe, thus left a widower, with
his little son Charles no more than four years
old, applied himself to his public work with a
redoubled zeal. His weight in Hampshire
during the early nineties, when that great
agricultural county was, I regret to say, flirting
with Home Rule, cannot be overestimated; yet
it formed but a slight part of his beneficent
influence. His speeches in the House of Lords
recalled the old days when he had been entrusted
by the government with the Bill to
which allusion has been made; and it was confidently
predicted that, on the restoration of his
Party to power, he would be given some post
in the cabinet.</p>

<p>These hopes were not fulfilled. His disappointment
appeared the more bitter, when
he considered how widely the journalists upon
whom he had wasted his attentions, had recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
spread his public reputation; it appeared
appalling when he contemplated the condition
of his fortunes. For, it must be admitted
(though it cuts one to the heart to expose the
humiliation of a man so prominent in our
commonweal) that, towards 1895, Lord Benthorpe
found himself deprived of all resources
whatsoever. The interest upon his various
mortgages was met precisely, in good years,
by the rent of his land and the products of the
home farm. In bad years by these combined
with the letting of Placton—a source alas! too
often insufficient.</p>

<p>Our society does not permit men to fall unaided.
If this is true of the generality of
citizens, it is still more true of those whose
names seem to stand for the stability of the
country itself. Help was immediately found.
The management of the house and estate was
taken over (together with the mortgages) by
the Anglo-Saxon Loan and Investment Company,
with which, by a happy coincidence, the
name of Mr Barnett was prominently associated.
The house and grounds were kept by this
financial company in a condition worthy of the
name they bore; and Lord Benthorpe was
generously permitted to make them his permanent
home, not only from a sentiment of
what was due to the dignity of his name, but
also from a consideration of the added value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
which he lent to the premises by his continued
residence.</p>

<p>I do not mention this magnanimity on the
part of a group of business men in order
to impair their reputation for shrewdness and
commercial capacity. Everything, down to
the wages of the servants, passed through their
hands; and they had made it a condition—a
condition to which Lord Benthorpe very readily
agreed—that even for such small hospitalities
as he might desire to extend to neighbours he
should, in every case, receive the written permission
of the mortgagees.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe, at the moment when the
great affair of the M’Korio entered the arena
of politics, bore an appearance which those unaccustomed
to our administrative classes might
have mistaken for weakness.</p>

<p>His figure, very tall and spare, was crowned
by a head in which the length of the face was
perhaps the most prominent characteristic.
His thin aquiline nose, his pale grey eyes, set
close together and drooping somewhat at the
corners, would not of themselves have led to
so false a judgment, nor would the shape and
position of his ears, to which the narrowness of
the head and the sparseness of the hair lent
perhaps an undue prominence; it was rather
his mouth, which, from an unfortunate habit,
he maintained permanently half open, thus displaying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
somewhat long and projecting teeth,
which met at a slight angle, as do those of the
smaller rodents. A slight growth upon the
upper lip emphasised the unfortunate character
of this feature, whose misleading effect was
further heightened by a nervous trick of
drumming or tapping continually with the
fingers, commonly upon his knee, but sometimes
upon the table, or whatever else might
offer itself to his hand.</p>

<p>As for his attitude, he would most commonly
be seen sitting with one leg crossed over the
other, and in an inclination of body that
gave no hint of the intellectual energy which
had inspired so many years.</p>

<p>I say that a foreigner imperfectly acquainted
with our polity, and even the less experienced
among our own fellow citizens, would not have
guessed what power and initiative the whole
picture concealed; but those of us who remember
the annexation of Raub, the firm
hand which suppressed the mutiny in the
Seychelles, the disappointment of Germany in
the Marranagoes, the settlement of Pilgrim’s
Island, and especially the dreadful affair of
Pútti-Ghâl, are not slow to recognise in Lord
Benthorpe, elements of that which has brought
our country to its present position among the
nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such was the man whom perhaps the best
judge of character in our time—I mean Mr
Barnett—had designed with slow deliberation
to associate in his great enterprise. Lord
Benthorpe and Mr Burden were the two pillars
upon which Mr Barnett intended the fabric of
the M’Korio Delta Development to repose.</p>

<p>Need it be added that he approached Cosmo
with a frankness native to all leaders of men,
that he pointed out the difficulties which would
surround any attempt to persuade the old
merchant, his father, of what the M’Korio
was and should be, and that he asked—almost
with humility—for the help of a young
man whom he had himself so conspicuously
befriended?</p>

<p>Need it be added that the request was no
sooner made than granted?</p>

<p>To the letter, with infinite tact, Cosmo (as I
shall show in a moment) carried out those
instructions which he knew so well to be to
the advantage, not only of Mr Barnett, his
benefactor, but of himself, his family, and
indeed the whole Empire. He was chosen
to bring into just those relations which the
situation demanded, his father, and that accomplished
politician whose impoverishment,
dignity, and judgment it has been my tragic,
but not unpleasing task, to recall in the chapter
which I now close.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Cosmo was too well acquainted with his
father’s temper, and, withal, too devoted
a son to shock Mr Burden by any sudden
introduction of matters upon which the merchant
must be presumed to judge far better
than he.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful thing—and a striking
thing in these days of irreverence and haste—to
watch the delicate and modulated steps
whereby my old friend was brought, almost
without his knowing it, to the brink of the
M’Korio. It was a process of that mingled
affection and reserve by which we daily see
the young leading the aged towards larger
things, but one which no mere written
description can fully convey.</p>

<p>The young man would leave a book of
Major Pondo’s in the hall by accident; Mr
Burden would pick it up under the impression
that it was a work of fiction: he would grow
sufficiently interested in it to take it into town
with him; he would remark the half-tone
blocks representing the dryer parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
delta: he would turn it sideways to glance
at the map of the river mouths; he would
glance with pleasure at the footnotes which
referred him to Scripture—and when he
brought home the book Cosmo would forget
its origin, but would remember at last that
it had been lent him by the son of Sir
Samuel Gare.</p>

<p>Had Cosmo any notes to write to Mr
Barnett or to Mr Harbury, he was careful to
write them in his father’s house, to address
them to their offices, and to fling them at
random upon the hall table whence they should
be picked up and posted; for his father hated
disorder, and, scolding, would catch them up
himself.</p>

<p>He would even at times reconcile it with his
conscience to address envelopes to fictitious
persons in the M’Korio settlement, or in the
delta where none resided.</p>

<p>He did not omit to leave the newspaper on
the breakfast table, so folded carelessly as to
present, among other things, whatever journalists
might have printed that morning upon
M’Korian matters: to the astonishment and
delight of his father he took to rising at an
hour earlier than the rest of the household,
that he might have the advantage of reading
the news in full before his father should come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
downstairs; but on those third or fourth days,
when the M’Korio was given a leading article,
he would keep the newspaper throughout the
meal, until his father was in a hunger for it
and would read it the more keenly.</p>

<p>With something approaching art he spoke,
and always spoke in praise, of whatever small
parcels had been invoiced from the office for
this apparently unimportant branch of the
firm’s business, but affected (wisely I think) to
ignore their destination; now presuming that
they were for China, now actually causing their
misdirection, and again mispronouncing the
name when his father reminded him.</p>

<p>He showed a curious anxiety with regard to
a trade gun which Mr Burden had received
as a sample from Birmingham. He was especially
interested in the coats of mail; it was he
who suggested to the Society for the Promotion
of Biblical Knowledge that they would do
well to write to a firm which penetrated the
interior of the country, and yet he who
asked his father from whom such letters came
and what reply should be given them.</p>

<p>In the commonest topics of conversation,
this atmosphere prevailed.</p>

<p>If his father spoke of cricket, Cosmo would
remember the curious aversion shown to that
game by the son of Lord Benthorpe, an aversion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
that had amused rather than annoyed so
excellent a bowler as Hagbourne, Mr Barnett’s
friend.... The match had been played on
Mr Harbury’s ground.</p>

<p>If his father mentioned a club, it either was
or was not a club to which Charles Benthorpe
or Major Pondo belonged.</p>

<p>Wine recalled the fact that it could not be
drunk in the tropics; whisky reminded him
that it had been declared by such authorities as
Sir George Mackintosh and Lord Bannochry
to be the healthiest beverage for pioneers in
the valleys of African rivers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when, after a few weeks of this
treatment, his father himself spoke directly
of the M’Korio, most obviously betraying
a mixture of authority and interest, Cosmo
with exquisite consideration turned the conversation
into almost any other channel,
and commonly fell to talking of his undergraduate
friends, of Imperial geography, or of
Mr Barnett’s great intimacy with, and salutary
influence upon, the resident members of the
University.</p>

<p>One way with another the M’Korio became
an atmosphere in that household, long before
the winter ended. It had all the qualities of
an atmosphere; ever present, circumambient,
necessary to life, yet but half perceived, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
invisible influence. When I consider that this
great result had been achieved by a youth
hitherto untrained in the beneficent activities
of commerce, I think no greater example could
be given of the power which has made modern
England.</p>

<p>That Cosmo was naturally absorbed in Mr
Barnett’s venture, and that his conversation
was bound to reflect it, I will not deny, but I
am confident that a conscious purpose animated
him, and a method learnt from his recent
association with greater men. For “there are
friendships,” as that erratic but original Cambridge
genius Colthorpe has remarked, “there
are friendships which are a liberal education....”</p>

<p>Thus, through the agency of a son, in a
manner which recalled the training of some
proud graminivorous creature for the use of
man by a method gentle yet firm, most filial,
most efficient, Mr Burden, in spite of the
routine of a lifetime, was gradually brought to
the vision of a great Imperial opportunity.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of March, after a
day spent in an attitude of curious reserve,
that he at last spoke plainly to his son of a
subject which had long occupied his mind.</p>

<p>In deference to his father’s wishes, Cosmo
had that day dined at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>It was late in the evening at Avonmore:
the fire lit in fitful glimpses the eight red
leather chairs ranged along the wall of the
smoking-room, the many photographs of Mr
Watt’s work and of that of the late Sir Edward
Burne-Jones, as also the noble engraving of
“The Gambler’s Wife,” which hung amidst
them in all its wealth of line and value.</p>

<p>The hour and the scene were propitious,
when Mr Burden committed himself to a confidence
unique in his lifetime; for, with the
single exceptions of Mr Abbott, whose advice
he most constantly demanded, of his head clerk
(a man of immense experience), and of his
sister, no human being, he could boast, had
inspired his ventures or had ever been privy
to his intentions.</p>

<p>His heir, however, his only son, who would
in time direct the whole fortunes of the house,
had a clear right of admission into so considerable
a change as that which he contemplated:
for that son’s evident good use of his academic
opportunities, and his excellent choice of acquaintance,
seemed to make him worthy of it
in spite of his innocence of affairs.</p>

<p>Rousing Cosmo, therefore, from the reading
of an article upon the <em>Decline of Portugal</em>, Mr
Burden very weightily declared a considerable
anxiety to be present in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Twice that day there had been some trouble
in the office about the trade with the North;
Cosmo was therefore to be excused if he immediately
sympathised with his father upon
the rise of freights to Reikjavick, and the
inexplicable dropping off of the demand for
English stoves in Iceland. Mr Burden assured
his son with remarkable solemnity that he was
mistaken. He paused a moment and said:</p>

<p>“You probably know, Cosmo, in fact you
certainly know by this time, that a portion of
our firm’s business is done with the M’Korio
Delta.”</p>

<p>Cosmo was far too loyal to deny his acquaintance
with that fact, but his features showed
how little it had occupied his thoughts. Mr
Burden paused again and frowned. He went
on:</p>

<p>“Now, this trade has never been of value
to us ... but I have often thought ... I
may have been wrong ... I have often
thought that it might have been developed if
I had looked more closely into the matter.”</p>

<p>After a full and yet more fruitful pause, the
third, but not the last, in the course of this
critical discourse, Mr Burden proceeded with
astonishing breadth and grasp to develop that
theory of commerce which distinguishes us
from our less fortunate rivals. Compelled as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
I am to condense his diction, I am yet careful
to repeat his actual phraseology, in a matter of
which he was a master and of which I cannot
even call myself a novice.</p>

<p>He set forth first that times were not what
they had been; that competition was keen;
that new markets had to be looked for; our
prosperity was indeed increasing, but the ratio
of that increase was declining. For a full ten
minutes he distinguished in the most lucid
manner between actual and comparative
growth; finally, he propounded with some
hesitation, yet warmly and grandly, as a
scheme or suggestion of his own, that the new
markets might be expected to arise in new
countries.</p>

<p>Cosmo, to whose vigorous if quiet mind
original theories immediately appealed, was
moved to a whole world of thought and allusion
by his father’s sudden insight. He recalled
examples of success achieved upon such lines;
Australia suggested many, Johannesburg many
more, nor did he neglect the Western States of
America; but he asked what the M’Korio
Delta, known so long, tropical, forgotten, could
have in common with these?</p>

<p>It was then that Mr Burden fully delivered
himself of the idea which had so long been
maturing in his brain; he hoped—he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
tell why—it was but a hope—yet he hoped that
the M’Korio Delta might prove one of those
undeveloped tracts of an Empire whose future
contained almost infinite possibilities.</p>

<p>“This idea of mine,” he added, “has been
singularly confirmed by one or two things I
have read, and certain chance allusions of
travellers in the last few years. I doubt whether
our explorers or our journalists have had quite
the same opportunities of judging the Delta as
myself; and I am not accustomed to form my
judgment upon that of other men. Nevertheless,
I am struck by the singular way in which
all modern research upon the matter seems to
converge towards my own original conclusions.”</p>

<p>When Mr Burden had said these things,
Cosmo, with a wisdom beyond his years,
pointed out the extreme risks attending all
colonial experiments. The risk was not perhaps
a risk to the nation as a whole; but it was
invariably present for the individual speculator.
His father nodded rhythmically and wisely as
his son betrayed in every phrase an increasing
caution, but he cut him short with a firm gesture.</p>

<p>“No one knows that better than I, Cosmo,”
he said. “I would not enter into any scheme
that did not promise to obtain a very large
support from the public, and, I hope, some kind
of official recognition.... When you are as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
old as I am,” he went on, as Cosmo would have
interrupted him, “you will know that official
recognition, even if it is unofficial,” here he
hesitated for a moment, “even if it is <em>informal</em>,
is what makes the public come in.”</p>

<p>And with this expression of opinion, Mr
Burden permitted to linger upon his lips, a faint
smile which showed the importance he justly
attached to his knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>He might have gone further, but Cosmo, for
all his freshness, knew what was passing in his
father’s mind. There ran in his voice a grace
and humility strangely contrasting with his
heavy features and attitude.</p>

<p>“My dear father,” he said. “If I could do
anything ... but no one takes me seriously in
business yet.” His eyes smiled as he said it.</p>

<p>His father answered proudly. “They will,
Cosmo, they will,” and never was his confidence
in the future better placed.</p>

<p>“I only know men just as friends ... I
know what you mean ... the University does
that ... I was thinking who of all that lot
understands the place best.... You know, for
<em>my</em> part,” changing his tone to a digression,
“I believe in it, but I mean politically; commercially
it wants all sorts of special knowledge
...” then his face filled with thought and he
stared at the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Mr Burden smiled tolerantly: he had a reminiscent
vision of his boy’s rapid successes:
of the academic triumph in Modern Languages,
and, still better, the firm friendships acquired
with men proud to be his equals ... perhaps
through these an introduction to families that
would accept or even search an alliance: such
early affections as.... But his reverie was cut
short by an inspiration of Cosmo’s.</p>

<p>“Why not ask Lord Benthorpe?” he said.</p>

<p>“Lord Benthorpe!” cried Mr Burden. He
was surprised and a little shocked, and he let it
be perceived.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe was a public man; it was
only by his own desire that he had not taken a
high place in his party. As it was, in administration
he had come near to being, he might
yet be, a great Imperial Figure. Mr Burden
could well remember how this somewhat
younger man had been acclaimed as a worthy
successor to his celebrated grandfather. His
reputation, especially in youth, had been surrounded
by that purely political atmosphere
which the patriotism of purely commercial men
turns into a halo. All these things Mr Burden
insisted upon openly in reply to his son. Perhaps,
as old men will, he somewhat exaggerated
the importance of a name which recent years
had somewhat lessened; but his life had run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
upon lines sufficiently remote from politics to
warrant his humility, and, if he doubted the
possibility of obtaining Lord Benthorpe’s advice
upon so small a matter as the M’Korio, it was
because he estimated at its full value the weight
of that advice, should he but have the good
fortune to receive it.</p>

<p>Cosmo was earnest. He protested that he
could not see his father’s objection. He did
not know Lord Benthorpe well, but he knew
Lord Benthorpe’s son extremely well. He
was absolutely certain, he said, that Mr Burden
misunderstood the simplicity of such men.
Then, apart from that, Lapthorne and Curley
had asked advice on neutral matters, and had
received it—he assured his father that Lord
Benthorpe’s world had for the City as great a
regard as ever the City for them; they knew
upon what the Empire reposed, and they saw—and
for the matter of that he, Cosmo, saw—that,
but for some communication between
the Benthorpes and the Burdens, the Empire
could hardly survive.</p>

<p>He would have said more in the same strain,
had not Mr Burden, whose pride was dimly
suffering from so much protest, risen, rather
abruptly, and announced a decision to take his
own time in the matter. His son had the tact
to say good-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>And Mr Burden also went to his room—but
for two hours he wrote and rewrote a letter in
the third person, in which Mr Burden presented
his compliments to Lord Benthorpe, and expressed
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oratio obliqua</i> his apologies, his request
for advice, and his trust that it might be
obtained. This letter that same night, very
late, Mr Burden carefully posted with his own
hand in the pillar-box nearest to Avonmore—the
pillar-box which stands at the corner where
Mafeking Avenue falls into Alexandrovna Road.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That night, before he slept, an indecision
oppressed Mr Burden. He felt he had taken
a plunge. He was not sure whether it was
for well or for ill; but he knew for certain
that he was on the way to unfamiliar places,
nor is such expectation congenial to men
grown old.</p>

<p>All the next day this double mood haunted
him. It was mixed with vague suspicions of
interference and quarrel; it left him ill at ease,
until, upon the morning of the morrow, there
reached him a charming note, straightforward,
easy and most terse; the notepaper was plain
and thick, the hand fluent, the phraseology
easy. It was a letter worthy of the care with
which Mr Burden preserved it. It spoke of
his son’s great promise, praised his University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
record and the multitude of his friends; it
begged that Cosmo’s acquaintance with Charles
might take the place of an introduction; it
assured Mr Burden, with open emphasis, that
no one in England had a greater right to consult
every judgment upon a matter where his
firm’s enterprise in trade had, almost alone,
laid the foundation of our power. Nothing
of moment remained, save the signature,
the simple word “Benthorpe,” written undoubtedly
with a thick quill;—and the old-world
courtesy of a postscript, begging that
Mr Burden would let the writer know upon
what day and by what train he would reach
Great Monckton, “the next,” ran the last
words of the letter, “the next after the quiet
little wayside station of Keynes.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is always a matter of balance for the
judicious mind, when it meditates an approach
upon Placton, whether it should travel by the
Great Western to Halsden Junction or the
South-Western line to Great Monckton. Each
is at an equal distance of three miles from the
mansion, but a host of considerations, which
might prove tedious to the anxious reader of
his fortunes, ultimately decided Mr Burden to
attempt the latter. It was from Waterloo, not
from Paddington, that he engaged upon that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
fateful journey which came so near to transforming
the fortunes of our race.</p>

<p>The mixture in him of audacity and routine—a
mixture common to the mercantile classes
of our countrymen—awakened the struggle
which lasted during the whole journey to the
quiet little wayside station of Keynes.</p>

<p>He was alone. In the days when the distinction
was of importance he had acquired a
habit of travelling first class; this habit he had
preserved. He owed to it the solitude which
permitted such a conflict to arise in his mind.</p>

<p>His fortune had been inherited from so solid
an ancestry, had been preserved by so persistent
an effort of probity and diligence, that
any speculation whatsoever had for him, at his
age, a savour of sacrilege.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the expansion of the
British Raj, his faith in its future, the example
of so many nations created out of nothing by
the confidence of his contemporaries, above all,
the remarkable wealth acquired by those who
had risked all upon the destiny of the Empire,
led him on to boldness.</p>

<p>Hard-headed business men are not easily to
be persuaded when opposing arguments present
themselves to the mind. Mr Burden was not
resolved when he reached at last the quiet little
wayside station of Keynes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>For a few moments he was at once bewildered
and annoyed at hearing that he was
required to change, but, when he had paid the
customary fees and found himself once more
alone in a well-lit carriage, this annoyance
disappeared before a renewal of the problem
which vexed him. His mind, however, was
vigorous, he bent upon that problem the fullest
of his energies, and, as the train pulled out of
the quiet little wayside station of Keynes, he
had very nearly arrived at the firm conclusion,
that so much was to be said upon either side, as
to make the judgment of some further adviser
necessary before a determination could be taken.</p>

<p>His mind was hardly fixed upon this excellent
solution when the train stopped; he heard
called the name of Great Monckton, and the
presence of a servant who led him to a carriage,
the honest English courtesy of the Porter,
Stationmaster, Guard, Newsagent, Ticket
Collector, and General Boy, the sharp country
air and the name of Placton several times
repeated, gave him that sentiment of repose
which accompanies the neighbourhood of the
great. And the carriage rolled, and scented
woods passed incessant through the evening,
and more and more did Mr Burden feel himself
to be approaching security and the basis
upon which our England is founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>There was a lodge, a fine gate cast in imitation
of wrought-iron and gilded in the Aylesbury
manner, an aged woman who courtesied
with astonishing charm, a drive of close upon
a mile, ancient and well-groomed trees, a square
church tower showing dimly against the sky,
and, in a dale which the drive skirted, a lake
with boat house, island and terrace, as in the
well-known view.</p>

<p>Mr Burden, noting all these things with pure
intent, felt something old in his blood: he
revered in his mind Lord Benthorpe’s mighty
image, and laid his doubts at the feet of so much
achievement and experience. He thirsted (if
I may use the phrase) for the presence of the
British statesman.</p>

<p>It was not long delayed. They led him into
that majestic house, dark, panelled, venerable:
walls so old that no man now living there had
seen them rise, oak felled before Her late
Majesty assumed the sceptre, furniture compared
with whose taste that of Prince Albert
was modern, deep carpets from Brussels and
Aubusson, pictures by the Oxford Turner, by
Etty, by Frith, by men whose very names are
forgotten—they led him, I say, past these
monumental splendours, till he reached a vast
apartment wherein by the light of two candles
of pure yellow wax Lord Benthorpe sat alone—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
illuminate spiritual figure startling against a
background of vague darkness and suggested
tapestries.</p>

<p>I have said enough of this statesman’s build,
manner and history to convince my readers that
the moment was supreme in Mr Burden’s life.
As he entered and was announced, he felt so
keenly the emotions of awe and gratitude that
he hesitated for a moment to advance.</p>

<p>What Lord Benthorpe had done and was,
all England knows: the conqueror of Raub
and the hero of Pútti-Ghâl.</p>

<p>Mr Burden was a merchant worth at most
but £257,000, and that locked up entirely in
his business; but no difference of fortune
affected the demeanour of the more illustrious
man.</p>

<p>With the commercial classes of three European
and fourteen Colonial capitals Lord
Benthorpe had been famous for that rare
power of putting his visitors at their ease: he
did not fail with Mr Burden. For though
that unaffected man broke into a cold sweat
under his first addresses, a short three-quarters
of an hour in the company of the soldier-politician
restored his power of speech and made
him feel the presence of a friend.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When it was evident that Mr Burden had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
entered this happier phase, Lord Benthorpe,
settling into an air of business, asked, as he
had asked so many in his active and useful
life, what he could <em>do</em> for his guest.</p>

<p>It was a formula he had been taught from
the nursery: he had used it upon inferiors of
every grade, and always with success—unless
I except an unfortunate interview with a cabman
which in no way regards these pages: for
whereas the cabman on that long past day had
poured out with many oaths a list of incongruous
things which Lord Benthorpe might do
for him, and closed it with a refusal of all save
the payment of the mere fare he had called to
collect, every other visitor, from the Secretary
of the Society for the Prevention of
Diseases to the Sendar of Raub had been
charmed to admiration by the manner in which
the phrase was delivered.</p>

<p>Mr Burden felt the spell, and it was with
evident gratitude in his voice that he declared
himself arrived to discuss the matter mentioned
in his letter.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe smiled without effort, and
tapping the table before him with his fingers
as was his wont, murmured twice:</p>

<p>“By all means.... By all means.”</p>

<p>Then there was silence in that great dark
room for the space of nearly four minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>A clock ticked solemnly in a corner, out of
sight, and every now and then Lord Benthorpe
tapped again with his fingers upon the table;
but for these there was no sound to mask Mr
Burden’s breathing. At last Lord Benthorpe
pushed back his chair, crossed his legs, supported
his left elbow on his knee, his head
upon his left hand, and said again in that low
meditative tone, which was so full of responsibility
and reminiscence:</p>

<p>“By all means....”</p>

<p>Without, in some remote ante-chamber of
the great building, a servant played upon a
gong of restrained and ample tones; the house
was filled with the summons, but softened as
it was, Mr Burden found in it a suggestion
rather than a command that he should dress
for dinner. With this object he rose.</p>

<p>His host preceded him, lit a candle with his
own hands, and showed the way up the staircase.
At its head opened a very wide
corridor, lit from above by skylights, and
hung with pictures which were part of the
glory of the house.</p>

<p>They passed one canvas after another, Lord
Benthorpe still holding and shading the candle,
Mr Burden listening with intelligent respect to
all he heard. This was Naples, that Lucerne;
a third Nice, a fourth Mentone—all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
strange, beautiful places Lord Benthorpe had
admired in the course of his extensive travels:
pictures ordered by him from local masters
whose name still stood clearly inscribed in the
bottom left-hand corner of their creations.</p>

<p>There were portraits too. A very fine, but
somewhat sinister figure, turbaned and sombre,
was his great-aunt Kathleen, his grandfather’s
only sister. His grandmother, represented as
the Tragic Muse, filled amply the next frame;
his grandfather the next.</p>

<p>Standing in his robes against a fringed and
tasselled velvet curtain of a rich purple hue
with a broken pillar at his side, while a sunbeam
bursting through a distant cloud, threw
into fine relief the orator’s gesture, the Great
Irishman was represented speaking in the
House of Lords in favour of the reform of the
Poor Law. His left hand touched with the
index finger a map of Great Britain; his right
was slightly raised to heaven in dignified
appeal. A wolf-hound nestling at his feet
indicated the domestic nature of his character,
for the taste of that time permitted the allegory
in spite of the grave improbability of such
a creature’s presence in such a place and upon
such an occasion.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the corridor, before a
painting more modern in treatment and hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
quite alone, they halted a moment in
silence. It represented a woman yet young:
hair of a colour similar to her own was caught
up behind her head in those ordered masses
once known as the Chignon; her skirt, which
was most ample, was of a brilliant pink; she
was seated writing at a superb escritoire, or
writing-table, holding a graceful quill in a
hand of which the little finger emerged
coquettishly above its fellows. The frame
was surmounted by the ornament of a dainty
coronet; upon the features an amiable smile
was recorded.</p>

<p>“My wife,” said Lord Benthorpe simply.
Then, after a long pause, “by Marsten ...”;
finally in a deeper and more subdued voice
... “from a photograph.”</p>

<p>The two men parted, and Mr Burden dressed
in profound thought, wondering to have seen
so much greatness united with such native
ease.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe had been granted by his
financial assistants the widest latitude for this
evening’s entertainment. Indeed, a cheque,
upon which no questions were asked, was sent
him the moment his request reached them. He
preferred, however, with inbred tact, to call but
one other guest to his table, lest the merchant
should be confused by too considerable a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
gathering. This other guest, chosen with
admirable judgment, was Mrs Warner, who
lived as an honoured neighbour in the seclusion
of her widowed cottage near by. Lord
Benthorpe introduced the clergyman’s widow
as is the custom among men of breeding, in a
voice so low and blurred as to leave Mr
Burden under the erroneous impression that
the lady, if not a peeress, enjoyed at least a
courtesy title; nor can I regret the trivial
error, when I reflect how admirably it served
at once to prove the equality that reigns over
all our social relations, and to afford, though
by an illusion, the most vivid interest and
pleasure to my dear old friend.</p>

<p>As for the meal that followed, not the mere
meats, though these also had been ordered by
the master of the house and cooked to singular
perfection—not these, but the subdued and
cultured converse which illumined it, are most
worthy of memory.</p>

<p>To a soup, clear, but if anything insufficiently
salted, and during the absorption of which very
little was said, succeeded a boiled turbot, whose
sauce, a mixture of butter and of flour, was
handed noiselessly from out the surrounding
darkness by a manservant other than he who
poured at intervals of due length, and at the
personal choice of each guest, hock or claret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Both these administrants, and yet a third,
who would occasionally appear and pass out
again through the immense portals of the
room, secretly astounded Mr Burden by the
perfection of their training, and the singular
dignity of their demeanour; nor could he
doubt that their features, though difficult to
discern beyond the circle of light which fell
upon the table, corresponded with their other
characteristics.</p>

<p>It was during the consumption of the fish
(turbot as I have said—and boiled), that Lord
Benthorpe, with practised good-will, opened
the verbal tournament by an allusion to Mrs
Warner’s little work, “Hours of Healing,” with
which he was sure Mr Burden had long been
acquainted. Mr Burden, in the act of disguising
his ignorance under a strong assertion of
his familiarity with the gem, could not but
admire within himself the literary skill of one
whose rank he imagined so exalted. It confirmed
him in his respect for a class which
gallantly neglects its gilded leisure, not only
for the service of the State, but also for that of
humanity at large.</p>

<p>To this impression Lord Benthorpe added
by asking, with apparent interest, whether or
not the work of the parish had recently
afforded matter for serious comment. Mrs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Warner replied that nothing of moment could
she recall since the affair in which her host, in
his capacity of Justice, had so amply seconded
her efforts to correct the disorders of a wandering
circus recently visiting the village.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Lord Benthorpe
was pleased with the recollection; a merited
content overspread his features as Mrs Warner
went on to describe the vigour with which the
lord of the manor had lent his influence to
discountenance, the magistrate his power to
punish, a case of gross cruelty to animals
which had taken place in this show.</p>

<p>It seems that a tiger having, in some
irrational fit, attached itself to the trunk of
the sole elephant the manager could boast,
was lashed off again by the application of a
horsewhip, the weals caused by which were
the more difficult to prove in court, both from
the inconvenience of bringing the victim before
the bench, and from the peculiar parallel
stripes already provided by nature upon the
poor creature’s hide.</p>

<p>When this relation was accomplished, Mrs
Warner had the tact to add that his lordship’s
experience in the East (an experience which
she coupled with the name of Pútti-Ghâl) had
luckily given him an ample knowledge of
tigers. He it was, she informed Mr Burden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
who had pointed out that in all such cases the
truer Christianity of our Indian fellow-subjects,
had long learnt to drag off the infuriated feline
by a steady pull upon its tail.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe asserted in reply that so
long as he had the confidence of His Majesty,
and was honoured by him with a Commission
of the Peace, there was nothing he would more
rigorously pursue than the inhumanity of the
lower classes towards dumb animals; and,
having so expressed himself, he once more
relaxed the momentary firmness of his lips,
and left to them their more usual expression
of open amiability.</p>

<p>At this moment appeared, with some ceremony,
a leg of mutton loading a dish of pure
silver, whereon the presence of little runnels
leading to one united depression for the
retention of the gravy, marked the practical
combined with the luxurious.</p>

<p>The conversation having turned upon tigers,
perhaps the most interesting of the animal
creation, and Lord Benthorpe’s experience in
the East having been, as was public knowledge,
manifold, it is little wonder if he
occupied the remainder of the meal in a somewhat
lengthy description of his adventures in
the pursuit of this game; for, though no class
of the community knows better when to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
silent, neither is any better fitted for sustaining
a monologue than that which the host of
the evening had adorned.</p>

<p>Making light, with becoming modesty, of
his own courage in the innumerable dangers
which he had encountered, he did not even
allude to the little affair at Pútti-Ghâl, save to
illustrate a point upon the habits of the tigers
which infest that neighbourhood. Nor was
anything in his many miraculous escapes
incredible to an audience as well informed
as were the merchant and the clergyman’s
widow upon the ferocity of wild beasts, and
the indomitable spirit of man.</p>

<p>Lest I should seem to lay too much insistence
upon what was, after all, but an
episode in Mr Burden’s career, I will dwell
no longer upon the close of the meal.</p>

<p>Of the pudding I have no record: there
is little occasion to mention the cheese.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">MRS WARNER’S RETREATING FIGURE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I must not, however, omit to praise the
gesture with which Lord Benthorpe opened
the door, nor that with which Mrs Warner
rewarded him as she swept through it to the
drawing-room beyond. As she left the room
Mr Burden, gazing at what he afterwards
called her retreating figure, could not help
marvelling at the simple grace, the total
absence of affectation, and, at the same time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>the wonderful dignity of her carriage. The
impression was heightened, not only by the
error into which he had originally fallen as to
her social rank, but by the striking character
of her dress, which was of a shining electric
green, comparable to that which illumines the
wing cases of certain tropical beetles.</p>

<p>In her absence the conversation flagged;
they slowly sipped their wine, and Mr Burden,
who had smoked after dinner every day for
nearly fifty years, waited most anxiously for
the appearance of tobacco. If none was
offered him, it was because Lord Benthorpe,
naturally clinging to what remained of his
ancient authority, forbade in the house which
yet sheltered him the use of a narcotic he
abhorred.</p>

<p>Mr Burden, remembering that such eccentricities
were but the tradition of an older
society which he profoundly respected, suffered
in silence; but his suffering impressed with a
monotonous dullness the few moments during
which Lord Benthorpe retained him to drink
wine. Indeed, until they rejoined Mrs Warner,
nothing passed between the two men save a
remark from Lord Benthorpe, that the stripes
upon the tiger, to which allusion had been
made during dinner, were a curious instance
of mimetic selection, permitting the man-eater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
to be almost indistinguishable from the tall
grasses wherein he lurked. To this Mr
Burden replied that Providence had endowed
all animals, even the weakest, with marvellous
opportunities for self-protection.</p>

<p>The conversation after they entered the
drawing-room, though full of interest and
charm, must no longer detain the reader, who
will have formed a sufficient judgment of its
character from the careful analysis which he
has just perused.</p>

<p>It was at the early hour of ten that Mrs
Warner left them, and Mr Burden, recognising
that an enforced departure before morning
prayers would leave but little time for discussion
on the following day, boldly approached
the subject which had brought him to Placton.</p>

<p>He put forward very earnestly his doubts
and his hopes upon the future of his African
trade; he told Lord Benthorpe frankly, how
vastly superior were the opportunities of the
politician to those of the merchant for determining
the probable future of such a district
as the M’Korio, and he asked, in the plainest
terms, for advice.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_151fp" style="max-width: 52.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_151fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">LORD BENTHORPE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF
BUSINESS-MEN TO THE EMPIRE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lord Benthorpe’s reply so greatly surprised
him, that he did not at first recognise its immense
importance. It was roughly to the
effect, that Lord Benthorpe himself had long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>been seeking a similar source of information,
and had determined, strangely enough, to
approach Mr Burden.</p>

<p>“I am very glad you wrote to me,” he said,
“because I believe myself to be by nature
diffident where initiative is required ... but
as you have written to me, believe me, Mr
Burden, it is not I who have to determine you,
but you that <em>have</em> determined me.... I have
seen the Empire, Mr Burden, in its broader
and its remoter aspect. Well,” here some
memory of public speaking seemed to seize
Lord Benthorpe, “well, after having so seen
it, near and far, in the snows of Canada, or
the burning deserts of Rajpootan, I can say
that it has never reposed, that I have never
seen it reposing, upon any other basis (upon
any other permanent basis) than the energy,
the shrewdness, the courage, and the probity,
of our English business men.”</p>

<p>As he spoke thus, Mr Burden felt new influences
flooding into his soul, and Lord Benthorpe
continued:—</p>

<p>“If you will allow me to say so, your view
of the M’Korio as a practical investment would
only complete and inform my knowledge of its
political future; but, between my knowledge
and your estimate, the latter is immensely the
more important of the two.”</p>

<p>Then it was that Mr Burden became greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
than himself. The confidence reposed in him,
the critical power which, however hidden from
others, he well knew himself to possess; the
just deference paid to his judgment and interest;
above all, the high recognition of a
successful career, affected him to the degree of
inspiration. He spoke of the M’Korio with
increasing confidence; he was carried on from
sentence to sentence, assuming a certitude
which, if he did not possess it as a positive
knowledge, he could claim by the more
divine right of prophecy. Nay, he exceeded
his own moments of strongest conviction;—so
true is it that the human mind, when it feels
itself the instrument of destiny, outleaps the
narrow boundaries of mere sensual experience.</p>

<p>Exquisite as was his breeding, Lord Benthorpe
betrayed a very genuine enthusiasm;
and when Mr Burden had reached the climax
of his harangue, the statesman was tapping
his fingers with such rapidity as to suggest
the antique rattle or the buzzer of modern
times. He looked up as Mr Burden ended
and said:</p>

<p>“Do you know, do you know, Mr Barnett?”</p>

<p>Mr Burden replied that his son was very
intimate with Mr Barnett and his friends, but
that he himself had never met him.</p>

<p>Then Lord Benthorpe described in some
detail the vision which Mr Barnett had conceived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
He told him how frequently Mr
Barnett had come to him at Placton and in
town, to discuss the possibilities of the
M’Korio; of how, more than once, a syndicate
had nearly been formed, but how they each
felt, he and Mr Barnett and a group of other
men, the necessity of more knowledge. That
solid knowledge they had now acquired.
Greatly as he admired Mr Barnett’s organising
power, and much as he respected, nay loved,
his ardent patriotism, he had mistrusted the
visionary until he had heard the practical man.</p>

<p>And now (Lord Benthorpe concluded) there
was nothing between them all and the creation
of a mighty province, save such few meetings,
one with the other, as the formalities towards
the formation of a syndicate required. He
would beg Mr Barnett or Mr Harbury to write
to Mr Burden, and they would meet, and the
thing should be done.</p>

<p>As is necessary in business, the two men
went over the ground again seven or eight
times, careful to add nothing to their former
conclusions, and before half-past one the future
was fairly clear.</p>

<p>Thus, thus was Mr Burden decided. I that
write this love my country, but I loved him
too; and I could weep to think that, in her
profit from his own action, he profited nothing;
but only died.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Lord Benthorpe’s descent and
training, of which my readers have received
an account, forbade him to exhibit haste
in his further dealings with Mr Burden. His
long administrative experience in the Orient,
with which these papers have already rendered
the Anglo-Saxon race familiar, equally forbade
him to leave his associates and friends long
ignorant of Mr Burden’s views. He wrote to
Mr Barnett immediately after Mr Burden’s departure
from Placton, and was charmed to
discover, in the reply, that the Empire Builder
was not so wrapt in his dreams as to forget
that a certain delay in money matters is the
mark of good birth. Indeed Mr Barnett
advised that several weeks should pass before
the matter was mentioned again.</p>

<p>Mr Burden, meanwhile, who was chiefly
acquainted with the narrow world of business,
read such delay to mean that his colleagues
were yet uncertain. At moments he feared
some governmental interference acting through
the powerful connection of Lord Benthorpe;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
at others he regretted the enthusiasm he had
shown at Placton for the new scheme. As the
days passed, he grew into a feverish and restless
state, very favourable for the due fruition
of Mr Barnett’s plans; and while I am bound
to regret the pain which such a process inevitably
caused my old friend, I am none the less
constrained to admit its ultimate wisdom.
Without some exercise of discipline, no
organiser can marshal his forces; and it is to
Mr Barnett’s honour, that he never pursued
such a method beyond the limits strictly necessary
to the mutual benefit of himself and of
the friends he would acquire.</p>

<p>Three weeks went by, and Mr Burden had
worked himself into a state of nervous irritation
pitiful for any to behold save those who,
like his son, were aware of the ultimate advantage
to which it would lead.</p>

<p>The merchant no longer mentioned the
M’Korio directly, but he continually brought
home new books upon that river; he purchased
a new atlas; he visited upon two occasions the
rooms of ill-frequented museums. His dignity,
which prevented him from betraying to Cosmo
his immeasurable anxieties, did not debar him
from a ceaseless conversation which was unnatural
and strange in him; he spoke of
Oxford, of Placton, of geography, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Roman Empire, of savages, of command of
the sea, of governing races, of the <cite>Times</cite> newspaper,
of wars. And, all the while, Cosmo,
with tenacious care, warded off every allusion
that pointed to the forbidden subject; under
his indefatigable calm, his imperturbable goodhumour,
his father’s health threatened to give
way.</p>

<p>In early May a coincidence brought to
maturity this period of preparation. Mr
Burden saw in the <cite>Times</cite> (which paper he read
at breakfast) that a German company designed
to acquire concessions in the Delta; in the full
agony of this news, he learnt—upon the same
morning—that Cosmo would meet Mr Barnett
at luncheon. The father and the son went
into town together. The morning was not
without tension. Towards one o’clock came
the moment when the tension could no longer
endure.</p>

<p>There was perfect restraint and good feeling
in the little scene. Cosmo took his hat in the
office, and remembered to say that he should
be a trifle late in returning, because he expected
Mr Barnett would appear at the club. Just as
he went out, his father, with unnatural joviality,
suggested that they should lunch together—they
so rarely lunched together. Cosmo’s
hesitation was not noticeable. Mr Burden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
rose; and so, for the second time, he came to,
and was not sought by, Imperial things.</p>

<p>They sat at a little table in a vast room,
over-luxurious but grand; they had already
ordered and received the baked mutton and
cabbage of their choice; when Cosmo stood up
and greeted warmly a figure, large and benignant,
which had appeared beside him. It
was Mr Barnett.</p>

<p>A whirl of confused emotions ran through
the mind of Mr Burden. The public reputation
was one thing to him, the splendid coat of
astrachan quite another; and when speech
began, the accent, gesture, and expression
meant yet a third. At the introduction, Mr
Barnett bowed from the hips, mechanically and
low, his chin upon his chest—a fourth confusion
combined with the others, where had Mr
Burden seen that posture before? He could
not remember—then it returned to him: it was
in 1878, in a farce called <cite>The Cologne Express</cite>;
never in real life had he seen such a salutation.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett drew a chair to the table, sat
down, and cleared his throat with the energy
characteristic of a master. Several men in the
club started round, and, seeing who it was,
smiled; two nodded: to one of them his nod
was returned. Then Mr Barnett, putting
both his weighty hands upon the table, slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
twirled his powerful if spatulate thumbs. He
spoke at last in the tone of decision and
initiative which gives such men authority. His
voice was directed towards a waiter of terrified
appearance; he ordered a bottle of “one
hundred and eighty,” and, when the bottle
came, a fifth emotion entered Mr Burden’s
mind, to observe that it was champagne.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett smiled.</p>

<p>Leaders of men have led men always by a
smile. Here also was a leader, and it is my
duty to describe at great length this individual
charm.</p>

<p>When Mr Barnett smiled, his lips, which he
kept closed, did not bend upwards as they do
with commoner and weaker men, but downwards
like an arch, lending an astonishing
vigour to his expression: the lower one, never
of a retiring curve, was thrust out superbly,
glorying in its capacity, and the whole mouth,
never exiguous, assumed heroic dimensions;
the while for a moment his considerable eyes
gleamed with kindly intelligence. At their
corners, three deep furrows spread rapidly to
his temples to disappear in the massive substance
of his face, when its features reassumed
their normal and somewhat drooping calm.</p>

</figure>

<p>Such was Mr Barnett during these rare
flashes which his friends already knew, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>which, after he had made the M’Korio, were
destined to captivate no less than two crowned
heads, a Prime Minister, four Admirals, ten
General Officers, editors in great profusion,
innumerable professors, and a whole army
of divines.</p>

<p>Such was the smile which illuminated the very
man from within, irradiated his genius and his
vision, fascinated for a moment—and was gone.</p>

<p>Not till he had drunk one glass of “one
hundred and eighty” did Mr Barnett fix his
eyes upon Mr Burden, and tell him, in a
measured manner, with what pleasure he now
met, by chance, a gentleman with whom their
arrangements were so soon to be made.
Having once broken the subtle barrier which
separates individuals and races from one
another, Mr Barnett manifested himself a
moulder and a maker of things in justly ordered
sentences, whereby he settled, within a few
moments, permitting no interruption, the nature
of the syndicate which would be formed, the
few to whom any knowledge of it should be
confined, and its object in the laying of a
foundation for what was to be the development
of the M’Korio.</p>

<p>Before Mr Burden well knew what had been
done, he was pledged to meet his colleagues
upon that day week at the Plantagenet Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>His adhesion had been but one disconnected
phrase at the close of Mr Barnett’s order of
the day: of so urgent a kind is the influence
of those who once perhaps led armies, but who
are now the captains of greater forces, leading
to victories which no soldier of the past could
understand.</p>

<p>This done, Mr Barnett drank another glass
of champagne, and then the best part of a
third, in silence, holding the edge of the table
with his bent hands, and gazing down. At
last he twice pronounced the English word
“So,” sighed heavily across the table, rose up,
as rise the terrible but majestic pachyderms of
the Asiatic continent, smiled once again, bowed,
turned to the distant door, shook its lintel with
the stately emphasis of his tread, and disappeared
in an atmosphere of dignity which
nothing marred, save the slight, continuous
curve of his back—an accident due to the
obesity of his advancing years.</p>

<p>The influence of the rare over the more
common mind, though by it alone can the
purpose of the world be forwarded, is not imposed
without friction and occasional pain.</p>

<p>Mr Burden suffered from an anarchy of
thought, perhaps, more than from a sense of
dependence or of peril; yet he suffered, and
Cosmo noted that he suffered. When, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
his father hinted that he should return
with him to Norwood and share another unaccustomed
meal, he had the self-control to
postpone the pleasure of a dinner he had
promised himself among friends in Covent
Garden, and to come to the comfort and aid
of the parent, of whose old age he had become
a kind of guardian and director.</p>

<p>Safe back at Avonmore, when they had
dined together alone in more than a hour of
silence, Mr Burden begged his son, upon
whose judgment he had begun to lean with
pathetic but insufficient faith, to come a walk
with him towards the heights of the hills.
They had not gone far in the warm, long
evening, before Mr Burden, who had been
looking towards the setting sun in silence,
spoke out.</p>

<p>“Cosmo,” he said—his voice had in it
hesitation, and something approaching querulousness,
“these things have a way of becoming
much bigger than one likes.” Then he added:
“I have not had anything yet to do with the,”
he hesitated, “the ... preparation of a
chartered company; but I know that it may
cost very little or a great deal ... and you
know, Cosmo, the money would be in other
hands. I could furnish my share for that
preliminary expense; I could do nothing more.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Then he waited as though for a reply, though
he had asked no question.</p>

<p>Walking slowly by his side, and in a tone of
thought, Cosmo, with one of those flashes of
modest common sense, which had recently so
delighted his father, pointed out, that the sums
subscribed to such syndicates were necessarily
large, but that they were by no means necessarily
spent. They were a margin. He gave
instances from his reading, and one or two
from the experiences of his friends. He defended
the Press from any silly accusation of
corruption; but he insisted upon the great
expense of producing a modern newspaper,
upon its vast circulation, upon the cost of advertisement,
which was sometimes spared by
the spontaneous action of public interest, but
had always to be provided for.</p>

<p>His father assented and listened.</p>

<p>Cosmo then showed how, in such a State as
ours, it is necessary that men of great position
should ultimately take their share in any quasi-political
adventure, and, though, of course, no
direct expense was incurred in exciting the
interest of politicians, yet indirectly the charges
were sometimes heavy, and must, in any case,
be foreseen.</p>

<p>Mr Burden, for his part, reminded his son
that the smaller the number of an original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
syndicate the larger the individual contribution.
He feared that he must be prepared for an
immediate sinking of many thousands of
pounds; it might be thirty, it might even be
forty. Much more than that had been sunk
by the first founders of the Seychelles Company.</p>

<p>Cosmo did not miss so obvious an introduction
to his theme. His father could not deny
that the men who risked so much upon the
Seychelles were now among the greatest and
best of the commonwealth; and he showed
very clearly that, if such syndicates were not
formed by a limited number of men, and those
able to and ready to invest largely, the chances
of success would be small. Nor did he omit
to praise Lord Benthorpe with respect, Mr
Barnett with awe, and Mr Harbury with
affection.</p>

<p>Across Mr Burden’s mind there passed
suddenly the features of his friend, Mr Abbott.
For a moment, perhaps, he thought of taking
advice in that quarter also. He wisely dismissed
the thought from his mind, or at least
postponed it until the first step should have
been taken.</p>

<p>They had by this time arrived at the top of
the hill, and were turned in reverie northward
and westward, to where the light was declining
redly behind evanescent effects of smoky cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>The soft air of Surrey blew upon them as
they gazed; it was laden with those peculiar
subtleties which only Londoners can understand.
It came from the glorious heaths of
Putney; from Kingston where the woods and
the river meet; it bore the spirit of Battersea,
of Clapham, of the Kennington Oval ... there
lingered in it suggestions of the “Elephant
and Castle,” of Camberwell, of the majestic
Thames itself: it blew upon and soothed the
father and the son, so that their conclusions
ran together, and the old man was ready for
the venture which the younger man defended.</p>

<p>When they had stood still a moment, to receive
this influence before turning back homewards,
Mr Burden, even as they turned, looked
at Cosmo and said more softly:</p>

<p>“It will be your money, Cosmo. Remember
that. I am speaking to you about your own
money.”</p>

<p>Cosmo answered in the voice of one who is
touched: a voice, which was perhaps the
noblest thing of the many noble things he had
acquired in his academic training:</p>

<p>“People talk like that, father ... but it is
yours, and will be yours for very many years;
it is you who may treble it or lose it.”</p>

<p>In the emotion of the moment, they walked
from Nelson Street to the corner of Kipling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Gardens before Cosmo spoke again, then he
said:</p>

<p>“If it were mine to-day, I should do it all
the more. You know more about it, father,
but you’ve asked me, and I have told you what
I think.”</p>

<p>Cosmo was right.</p>

<p>He is, indeed, no longer a shareholder in the
company, nor was he even a shareholder when
the Government bought at 5⅜xd; but he held
for a full seven months after his father’s death,
he sold at 17¼, and a good two-thirds of the
fortune he now enjoys is due to his sound judgment
during that evening walk in Upper
Norwood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have written “when the Government
bought at 5⅜.” The thought has perhaps no
right to appear in this account, but I cannot
forbear to place on record my regret that Mr
Burden did not live to see that great silent
scene in the House of Commons when the
Government announced their intention of
buying out the Company. It would have set
his foolish doubts at rest, and would perhaps
have preserved a life of such value to the
Empire, to the City, and to the residential
portion of South London. I knew him perhaps
better than other men knew him (if Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
O’Rourke will forgive the phrase); and I am
most confident that the King’s Own Ministers
purchasing, in their public capacity, the rights
of the Company for the nation, at the price of
5⅜xd, would have satisfied every murmur and
every suspicion in the mind of the man who
some months before, was for casting all away
at 2<span class="xs"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>. Alas! before even the first negotiations
had been opened at Lady Manningham’s
garden party, my dear old friend was dead.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It took five days to make those arrangements
which Mr Burden found necessary to put
within his immediate call the sum of £50,000.
What those arrangements were my commercial
readers can easily guess, my non-commercial
readers would be at a loss to comprehend.
That large class who, like myself, comprehend
them, and yet are not commercial, would discover
nothing but tedium in their recital.</p>

<p>That so considerable an amount was realised
so soon, was due to a variety of settlements;
the selling of stock, the immediate discounting
of certain maturing bills, but principally to an
advance very readily made by the bank, and
that at a rate of interest which seemed to Mr
Burden so generous as to be, in the technical
language of commerce, “almost nominal.”
Indeed, it raised him very appreciably in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
own opinion; and made him see in himself a
man of greater position than he had imagined.</p>

<p>I am betraying no confidence when I say
that the ease with which this loan was obtained
was in no small part due to the universal activity
of One Who has often appeared in the pages of
this sad record. If any further reward beyond
the natural pleasure which proceeds from a
good action may be of value to Him, He may
take this assurance from my pen that He made
a good man happy for more than thirty-six
hours.</p>

<p>On the evening before his rendezvous at the
Plantagenet Club, Mr Burden, as usual, returned
to his home by the 5.13. Cosmo he did
not expect; for the young man moved, as his
father well knew, in another, and as he hoped,
a better world. He read, therefore, all that
evening, to beguile his thoughts, a novel dealing
with the conflict between science and religion.
At half-past ten he went to bed.</p>

<p>It is a matter somewhat curious, but vouched
for by a serving maid of the name of Hannah,
who brought hot water to his room, that he
said his prayers. I mention the point only to
illustrate the attitude of his mind at this critical
moment. He went to sleep before eleven;
but his sleep was disturbed with dreams; in
these dreams the grotesque, unhappily, mixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
with the terrible, and there ran through them
that reminiscence of the immediate past which
is a sure sign of disturbance in the Ganglions
of the Cerebellum.</p>

<p>He dreamt that many men of many kinds
were offering him money in incredible amounts,
as loans, as gifts, as reversions, as exorbitant
prices for securities which he held; and yet
these offers did not please, but vaguely disturbed
him, for they were made by sundry
beings with faces always distorted, sometimes
horrible, who sat beside him on the seat of a
hansom cab, wherein he drove. In the corners
of this cab, before him, were bottles of champagne.
It was brilliantly lit, and he could see
outside in the darkness between the shafts, that
it was drawn not by a horse, but by his friend
Mr Abbott. The dream was evil, and, though
he knew not by what the cab was driven, yet
he knew there sat up there some Thing which
he did not care to think of, and which he did
not dare to see. Twice he would have lifted
the trap to glance furtively; twice his hand
failed him and his body grew quite cold with
fear. Such is the nature of dreams, that he
found the event but ordinary when the hansom
turned into a bath chair, running of itself, and
this again to his own bed, which seemed to be
at once in his own bedroom, and yet in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>crowded street; up and down this street he
noticed a multitude of people, nearly all of
whom he knew, going to their business. The
last of them came, a healthy, up-standing figure,
tall, strong, rubicund; he was well familiar
with it: it was that of the Honourable, the
Reverend Peregrine Mauclerc, vicar of St
Judas’s, Denmark Hill, a church he constantly
attended. This figure, passing rapidly,
nodded at him in a breezy way, and cried
cheerfully and very loudly: “It will be paid
for in shares.” Then an awful spasm of pain,
come and gone in a twinkling, incredibly
severe, shot through his chest; and Mr
Burden suddenly awoke.</p>

<p>He was gasping and sitting upright; to his
astonishment it was quite dark. Never had
his regular sleep been broken by such a sharp
and dreadful agony: rarely had it been broken
at all for many years. Indeed, since his
father’s death, and the relief from political
discussion which followed it, he could remember
nothing of the night save evening,
and then daylight again.</p>

<p>But now he found himself staring at darkness,
with his left hand at his chest. The
pain had darted and vanished like the stab of
a dagger; but the shock was still in his brain.</p>

<p>There lay under his pillow a gold watch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
presented to him, after their release, by the
officers and men of the Commander-in-Chief’s
Own Fighting Body-guard, in recognition of
his services and generous subscription to the
Prisoners’ Funds. It was of great value;
upon sliding a small spring along the side this
watch would strike the hours and the quarters
and the minutes, while pressure upon one of
three jewelled buttons caused it to render
<em>Hearts of Oak</em>, or <em>The Wearing of the Green</em>,
or Mr Kipling’s <em>Kill ’im wid yer mouf</em>; but
these Mr Burden very properly left silent, save
when he would amuse the children of his
friends.</p>

<p>Mr Burden pressed the spring: it chimed
him half-past two, and then three little tinkling
minutes. Mr Burden did not lie down. He
still sat up there in bed, his left hand on his
chest, his right hand upon the pillow supporting
him: and still he stared at darkness.</p>

<p>There are moments, under the brooding
fixity of the night, when the mind loses foothold.
The man was old, his infirmity of purpose
in the single matter of this new investment
I have described; his doubts, which were the
product of a morbid atmosphere rather than of
a reasoned view; his fear, which had become
an irritable fear.</p>

<p>All these the night increased. The magnitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
of the sum he risked, the still greater
peril of the adventure into which that day
would lead, appalled him. He was in great
dread and disquiet of mind, and he felt, though
he did not know it, like those young poetasters
who put into their verse the longing to be in
other times and away from something evil in
the modern world. It was a mood of intense
weakness, due, I believe, to illness alone, but it
affected all his attitude during the ensuing days.</p>

<p>After some twenty minutes of this suffering
he slept again, uneasily, dreaming confused
dreams; he woke again in the grey light for a
moment, his mind troubled by some phantasm
of a quarrel waged in sleep, and he tossed into
the morning. By seven he could rest no more.
He got up and dressed; day and activity began
to invigorate his mind. The quiet confidence
of Cosmo at breakfast, the leader in <cite>The Times</cite>
upon the corruption of Russia, the cat upon the
rug—all the familiar things of home strengthened
him, like sacraments, for the thing that
he had to do.</p>

<p>Only once that morning did his miserable
hesitation return. It was when he found himself
in the station at Norwood, standing, not
on the platform for the City, but opposite, on
that for Victoria. The novelty of the thing
again disturbed him; but he was brave. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
shook off the influence, and, when he stepped
out at his journey’s end, the movement and
the vigour of the streets revived in him a better
mood. His confidence increased as he stepped
through the summer morning; he entered Pall
Mall briskly, in the attitude of expectation and
advance, and he went up the steps of the Plantagenet
Club with something as near triumph
in his heart as men of that sober and even
temper can feel.</p>

<p>This was not an end for which he had
worked; it came as a kind of unexpected
reward for a life that had been regular, industrious,
and, in its fundamental emotions,
consistently patriotic. Of the many feelings
which men have mixed in them upon those
great days when they are admitted to take an
active part in the expansion of our power, two
were supreme in him at that moment. He
felt, with a freshness almost of youth, as though
he were himself about to create a new thing
on the map of the world.</p>

<p>He felt the warmth which cannot but accompany
a prospect of additional fortune.</p>

<p>From these two sources there proceeded an
exultation which was not ignoble, and which
went forward with a conquering movement,
lifting his heart as he entered the great doors.</p>

<p>Within those doors some indefinable cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
breath did strike him. Even in that present
mood of his, he could not shake off an impression
of strangeness. The furniture was
not what he knew; it was recent; it belonged
to a more glorious but certainly a
less commodious age.</p>

<p>It was bent into the strangest patterns;
fantastic curves met here and there in the
faces of young unhappy women. There was
applied to it by screws moulding which would
have required the utmost art of the sculptor
had it not consisted of composition.</p>

<p>The club quartered the three leopards of
Anjou, gules regardant on a field argent with
the Lys semé argent upon a field azure: in
chief a crown royal and supporters, dexter, a
lion rampant languetirant, sinister an unicorn,
enchainé: gartiered the device, “Honi soit qui
mal ‘pense,’” and the legend “Dieu et mon
Droit” real. This coat was blazoned above
the mantelpiece, on the backs of the sofas,
the buttons of the servants’ livery, the notepaper
and the china; it was woven into the
tapestry; it covered the seats of the chairs;
nowhere was the proud title of that house left
unsymbolised.</p>

<p>In the general decoration of the hall and of
the rooms, enormous masses of perfectly new
gilding lit up the interior with a grandeur that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
recalled Empire indeed, but suggested also the
strain inseparable from great possessions; and,
in between the gilding, panels of a dead foreign
white forbade Mr Burden such repose as he
imagined should pervade a London room.</p>

<p>There were, it is true, upon the walls, reproductions
of eighteenth century engravings, very
charmingly framed in the American manner.
The good taste of their arrangement was
marked: they were few and widely spread;
but of this Mr Burden knew nothing; his age
had narrowed him, and he did not comprehend
our day.</p>

<p>He stood in the midst of the hall, as might
some sea-faring man who had sailed and found
a people most unlike his own. He stood and
waited. Then the stronger mood returned to
him, and he forgot these things; for Lord
Benthorpe, Mr Barnett and Mr Harbury had
come into the room together. He went forward
to meet them.</p>

<p>When they had shaken hands, Mr Barnett,
absent-minded as are many men of his calibre,
went before them with unconscious mastery,
and led them into a little room apart, where
they could talk undisturbed; and this had
been reserved for him, for in that club Mr
Barnett held already the position which in a
few years he was to hold in the commonwealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
itself. Here, in this small room, were the same
good taste, the same grandeur of decoration;
but, for Mr Burden, now recovered, no longer
the same feeling of ill-ease.</p>

<p>They sat grouped round a table of fumed
oak, on which a dainty printed card begged
members to pay for the refreshments of their
guests, while above them hung a very sensible
admonition against the bestowal of gratuities
upon the domestics of these regal rooms.</p>

<p>They sat for a full quarter of an hour,
talking in sparse and careless sentences,
now of politics, now of some book, and
each from time to time would look up cheerfully
and say that they should be getting to
business.</p>

<p>Already had Mr Burden professed his
interest in the architecture of the club (for
they had drifted on to that topic), when Mr
Barnett replied, quite suddenly, that they had
but one thing to settle that day, and that
thing was the sum which they four must
syndicate before the promotion was entered
upon. He waited for no comment, but continued
with equal abruptness, saying that, so
far as he could see, a hundred thousand pounds
between them would command all that was
required for the security of their further steps;
and, when he had said this, he sat silently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
with his great hands upon his great knees,
looking down upon the floor at his feet.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe had the advantage of Mr
Barnett in a wider knowledge of the world,
and, from his Parliamentary training, a kind
of subdued fluency. Mr Barnett had brought
out the sum of money almost brutally. He
had spoken rather slowly, choosing his words,
as he always did. It was a necessity for him,
if he was to avoid the slight foreign accent
and the suspicion of foreign idiom, which even
so he could not quite eliminate. After that
hard and broken phrasing, it was a relief to
hear Lord Benthorpe. His amiable mouth
lay open between each phrase, his eyes roved
from one object to another around the room;
he sat, indeed, too far from the table to relieve
upon it the appetite for movement which pursued
his fingers, but he twisted them in and
out by way of pastime during his discourse.</p>

<p>“I think,” he said, in a thin voice, well
suited to dialectic, “I think the sum is large
... larger perhaps than is necessary. In
theory, as it were, there is very little needed....
I know one must always have a platform,
as it were ... we shall have initial expenses,
so to speak ... but....”</p>

<p>And then the voice of Lord Benthorpe died
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Mr Harbury joined in with a more definite
remark:</p>

<p>“If anything the sum should be greater.”</p>

<p>He said it with the decision and simplicity
common to men of his type when they discuss
a great financial matter. They are in daily
contact with these things, and they speak of
them as you and I speak of a road with which
we are familiar, or of any of the common
actions of life. He continued:</p>

<p>“It should be greater, because the whole
thing is a reserve for a very important campaign.
Lord Benthorpe is right. In theory
there is nothing needed; in practice, very
often the expenses are small. But one must
have a perfectly free hand. One must know
exactly what one is doing, and one must never
be forced to hesitate from lack of funds.” He
paused a moment, as though looking about
him to find a convenient phrase which would
not wound.</p>

<p>“A thing like this,” he went on, still firmly,
“which is mainly political, may mean less
expense than a scheme purely commercial,
but it may also mean a sudden and unexpected
strain.”</p>

<p>Then, as men do who are wiser than their
fellows in the matter they discuss, he added
an abrupt example:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Do you remember the Thibet irrigation
loan?”</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe looked at him and nodded,
more from courtesy than from any other
motive, for, as a fact, he had never heard of it.</p>

<p>“I remember it too,” said Mr Harbury
grimly, “and that came of what I call starving.”</p>

<p>He looked at them with a steady confidence,
knowing his ground thoroughly, and continued:</p>

<p>“We are all of us men of substance, and
men of affairs, and we can all, if we like, increase
the sum.”</p>

<p>Here Mr Burden nodded. For the first
time in the conversation he clearly understood
one whole phrase.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe was almost agitated.</p>

<p>“We could always add,” he said, “if there
were any necessity;” and, as he said it, the
little nervous trick with his hands began again.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury shut his lips very tight. When
he opened them it was to say:</p>

<p>“You can’t do business that way,” and then
he shut them again.</p>

<p>Mr Burden thought he would speak, and
did so, with a mixture of sense and self-respect:</p>

<p>“I shall be happy to abide by any decision
that you come to, gentlemen. I was certainly
prepared, now or ultimately, for a much larger
sum.... But I will, of course, be bound by
Lord Benthorpe’s prudence; and by the sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of you all, gentlemen; ... by the sense of
you all.”</p>

<p>Mr Burden delighted in these phrases; they
gave him a solid pleasure; and he went on:</p>

<p>“For my part,” ... he was about to tell
them that for his part he thought that more
was needed, when he suddenly remembered
that he was hopelessly out of his depth, and
putting on a look of firmness and reflection,
he was silent.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe began:</p>

<p>“Still, so far as I can see ...” then he
also remembered that he knew nothing at all
about such things, and was silent in his turn,
still preserving over his projecting teeth that
wide, open, permanent and kindly smile, still
twisting his refined and lengthy fingers.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury had already said: “After all,
we shall only be out of our money for a few”
... when Mr Barnett interrupted, with his
strong and ponderous voice.</p>

<p>When two such men begin talking together,
there is usually a kind of battle to see which
voice shall survive; but the relations between
Mr Harbury and Mr Barnett were such, that
Mr Harbury at once yielded, not without
grace, and Mr Barnett, choosing his words,
and speaking very slowly, taking care to make
a “d” a “d,” and a “t” a “t,” and steering
firmly past the “th,” rolled out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“It must be a hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>Mr Harbury said that the Magnetic syndicate,
if he remembered rightly, had subscribed
something of the same kind during the Greenland
excitement. Mr Burden, who had read
all about the Greenland excitement in the
papers, exclaimed: “What a time that was!”
Mr Harbury then added that there were infinite
possibilities all across the north of Canada,
and especially on the lower Snake river.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe told, at somewhat too great
a length, a story about his cousin, Charlie
Corne, who had gone shooting up there.
Mr Harbury listened with great interest, and
remarked that it was nothing to the Big
Moose country; and that led him to speak
about the fishing there, and that to the harbour,
and that to the dispute with Russia.</p>

<p>For close upon an hour their speech turned
thus upon those things wherein a conquering
race delights; and if I have painted the scene
of their first meeting at so great a length, and
in such detail, it is but due to my desire that
every member of this race, who may read
these pages, shall know in what an atmosphere
the crucial decisions of their history
are decided.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">MR BURDEN OFFERING TO SUBSCRIBE WHATEVER MAY BE NECESSARY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The interest flagged. Lord Benthorpe had
repeated the same sentence two or three
times; Mr Harbury had not spoken for close
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>upon eight minutes, when Mr Barnett closed
the scene. He got up with the air of a man,
heavy with creative power, one who has accomplished
a long and finally successful task; Mr
Harbury got up like an athlete ready for new
labours, standing erect and supple. Lord Benthorpe
got up, as politicians do, wearily, and by
sections of his frame; and Mr Burden got up,
as do merchants, with some fuss, rubbing his
hands, and pulling occasionally at his coat.</p>

<p>It was not his habit to leave a business
interview without some final phrase. He
would have thought it discourteous. He
stood, therefore, a little pompously, and,
looking at Mr Barnett, addressed him in the
plural, and said:</p>

<p>“Remember, gentlemen, I shall be very
happy, if there is any occasion, to post you
my cheque to-night for a larger....”</p>

<p>But Mr Harbury put up his hand with
authority, and interfered:</p>

<p>“Do not mention it, Mr Burden; the
suggestion was mine, but I think Mr Barnett
has thoroughly proved to us that the sum
proposed is sufficient.”</p>

<p>Then he let his hand drop again, and Mr Burden
bowed, and they all went out of the room.</p>

<p>So it was that, two days afterwards, Mr
Burden paid not forty, nor even thirty, but
only twenty-five thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The Rev. Charles Gapworthy, B.A., sometime
fellow and chaplain of St Lazarus
Hys Hostel, Bermondsey, S.E., tells us in his
“Political Economy for Schools” (chap. ii.
“Capital,” p. 28) that “economic force resides
ultimately, not in material accumulation, but
in a certain bold prevision of the mind.”
The truth is but one more example of the
power residing in what we denominate, in this
country, the “Christian virtue of Hope.”</p>

<p>The M’Korio Delta Development Company
had been but an idea. That idea had even
seemed, for some months, to languish, when
the accession of Mr Burden’s reputation, his
Faith (which had made the formation of the
syndicate possible), and, for that matter, his
twenty-five thousand pounds, though they were
but the outward sign of inward spiritual things,
lent to the whole adventure body and life.
Its aspect changed; it became concrete, as it
were: a thing to be named, handled, criticised,
combated, defended with passionate enthusiasm;
a national Force in Being.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett was the first to sacrifice himself
in the cause for which so many in the end laid
down their all. He left the Edgeware Road,
and took a considerable mansion overlooking
the Park, convenient to the Twopenny Tube,
possessing a southern aspect, and so near to
the Marble Arch as to boast nobility of site.
He thought it his duty (and the future has
proved him wise) to hire a carriage with two
horses, men in livery, and a box at the Opera:
nor did he hesitate to ensure to the daily
papers, even to those with whose editors he
was intimate, a fixed contract of advertisement,
in return for which, as the courtesy of journalism
demands, certain of his doings were
published, and commentary upon others
omitted.</p>

<p>If it be true, as Canon Cone has so beautifully
put it in his Christmas sermon on Kingdom,
that “we can serve England better with
our heads than with our hearts,” most nobly
did Mr Barnett serve her.</p>

<p>His dinners, the principal of which were
given weekly upon Fridays, when Parliament
was resting from its labours and before the
well-earned week-end had begun, his dinners,
I say, recruited their guests with a peculiar
discretion. Rarely did more than twenty sit
down together, never, even when that number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
was exceeded, did men or cooking of inferior
value weaken the effect of the meal.</p>

<p>Gatherings less formal distinguished or enlivened
the remaining evenings, saving that of the
Sabbath, which, in fine contrast to so many around
him, Mr Barnett remembered to keep it holy.</p>

<p>His suggestions were an inspiration, not
only to the young men whom he had launched
into our world of Letters, but to a multitude
who had hitherto known him only by repute,
and who, in spite of the legendary difficulty of
approaching so great a man, were introduced
to him in batches—before lunch, at tea times,
and (by appointment) in the early morning.</p>

<p>By a happy coincidence, the very force of
things seemed to fight upon his side. “The
stars in their courses,” as Canon Cone, careless
of political opposition,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> magnificently put it,
“fought for,” the tradition of which Mr Barnett
was but a part, however distinguished.</p>

<p>Men influenced by Mr Barnett in no way;
men who had never met him, were caught by
the flame of his genius.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Marshall, for example, if anything
a recluse, sent to <em>The Nineteenth Century</em> (and
after) from his distant home at the Land’s End,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>his famous article upon Germany and the
M’Korio valley.</p>

<p>Young Coster chose for his principal picture
of the year the title, “Moonrise upon the
Marshes of the M’Korio.” It was hung upon
the line ... and so upwards to the ceiling, and
though its dimensions caused a considerable
portion of its area to escape the eyes of the
spectator, its main features attracted universal
attention. Indeed, it was in stepping back to
obtain a comprehensive view of it, that Sir
Henry Baile cannoned into the aged Duchess
of Lavington, who was herself lost in contemplation
of the canvas. The contretemps and
the unhappy scene it led to, would be too
trivial to find a mention here did they not serve
to show the public zeal for all that concerned the
M’Korio. That picture also furnishes, by the
way, what I believe to be the only example of
any direct interference on the part of Mr
Burden himself with a national enthusiasm
which he rightly regarded as the stronger for
its spontaneity: I mean the little note in which
he begged the artist to change the word
“marshes” to “lagoons,” a request which was
at once complied with.</p>

<p>In the New Gallery a powerful piece of
impressionism, “The River of Fate,” by Miss
Paxter, turned upon the same theme; all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
London talked of the blue-eyed Somersetshire
lad, who lay there in his khaki, floating with
upturned face upon the dark waters. The
public subscription which was raised for his
aged parents, and their subsequent conviction
for fraud, are not to the purpose of my tale, unless
it be to take this opportunity of defending
Miss Paxter with all the warmth of which I am
capable, from the suggestion that she knew the
old people to be childless, or the incident itself
to be fictitious.</p>

<p>A further proof of Mr Barnett’s self-abnegation,
and of the absence of all financial pressure,
during the growth of the movement, exists in
the fact that Messrs Pscheuffer, desiring to
publish a book upon the M’Korio Delta, wrote
to Mr Barnett, and that he, with a fine sense
of what was due to his honour, refused to write
so much as the preface, or even to accept the
dedication of the volume. He referred the
firm to Major Pondo, and washed his hands off
the whole matter.</p>

<p>The success of the M’Korio village at Earl’s
Court, if a plebeian, was yet a genuine indication
of the popular feeling. It was crowded
throughout the season; and the chief, a magnificent
Basuto named Issachar, was pensioned
by an enthusiastic admirer who prefers to remain
anonymous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Even the neglected museum of Theoretical
Geography received, for the first time in forty
years, a daily influx of visitors eager to behold
the raised map of the M’Korio Delta. The
absolute flatness, and consequent ease of
cultivation, of the region could not be better
appreciated than in this graphic form.</p>

<p>Two rival hosiers, having each patented a
type of collar under the name of “The
M’Korio,” went to law to decide which should
have the right of using so valuable a title.
The case was reported at great length, and
aroused the widest interest and discussion. It
is one of his many acts of private generosity,
so few of which I have been able to record in
this book, that Mr Barnett recouped the loser
of this action for his trouble and expense out
of his own pocket, and gave him a handsome
present beside.</p>

<p>Finally, in a <em>brochure</em> of the utmost interest,
based upon vast research, and expressed with
admirable economy of proof, Dr Mohl, of the
University of Dorpott, conclusively identified the
Delta with the Sheol of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>I would it were my lot to set down nothing
save the positive side of this wave of success;
but I owe it to Mr Barnett, and also to the
truth, to touch upon such opposition as the
movement encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>This opposition was not always consciously
exerted. It existed none the less.</p>

<p>An article appeared in a German Review
advocating the purchase of the Delta by Germany,
with one of whose colonies it was coterminous.
The wound it dealt was the deeper
from the fact that Mr Barnett’s own second
cousin, Baron Bloch, was the author of the
article, which appeared above his pseudonym
of “Sympathicus.” It was good to hear the
outburst of indignation with which this proposal
was met in England. We were saved
by the rally of our own blood to our side. The
article “Git,” which appeared in the principal
American newspaper in London, was undoubtedly
the turning point, after which the City
and the banking interest determined to support
what was feared at the time to be the vacillating
policy of the Government.</p>

<p>Owing to the persistence of a very wealthy
private member, whom no arguments could
mollify, unexpected difficulties arose in the
transference of the Delta from the Foreign to
the Colonial Office, a trifling but necessary
formality which could not be accomplished till
much later, in August, when the close season
for grouse was at an end.</p>

<p>The correspondent of <cite>The Times</cite> at Kurù, in
a long course of articles, which did more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>anything else to teach the monied classes what
the M’Korio might mean, never once mentioned
the company nor any of its supporters—and
there are conditions under which such
neutrality is dangerous.</p>

<p>Against all this Mr Barnett bore up with an
heroic tenacity.</p>

<p>There was but one feature in all the field
before him which gave him any serious anxiety,
and this was that unhappy vacillation which I
have already so often shown Mr Burden to
have displayed, from the moment that he
plunged into efforts ill-suited to his training
and experience.</p>

<p>It was necessary, upon the face of it, that
Mr Abbott should be invited to join the original
promoters, to “chip in,” as Mr Barnett put it
in somewhat excessive joviality of phrase.</p>

<p>But Mr Abbott was Faroosh. None but
Mr Burden could approach him, and frequently
as he had been asked to do so, Mr Burden
hesitated; a childish hesitation; a man shrinking
from a scene.</p>

<p>But if Mr Abbott’s directorship could wait,
there were other and more disquieting symptoms
in Mr Burden’s manner. He had fits of silence.
For days he saw eye to eye with all his colleagues—and
then, suddenly, a note would
come, short, querulous, excusing himself from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
attending the most important functions. At
last, during the great reception in the beginning
of July, Mr Barnett grew seriously concerned.</p>

<p>My pen has not the leisure to describe the
brilliancy of that function. It was a scene
which could not be matched in any capital of
Europe, hardly in London itself, elsewhere than
in the little district which is bounded on the
north by Hyde Park Square and Seymour
Street, on the east by Park Street, on the
south and west by the misty distances of Hyde
Park. It was worthy of all that was said of it
in the <cite>Morning Post</cite> upon the one hand, in the
<cite>Indépendence Belge</cite> upon the other—but I can
mention it only in connection with Mr Burden’s
distressing mutability.</p>

<p>One thing had given Mr Barnett real hope;
and that was Mr Burden’s attitude towards
what I may call the more common-place side
of all this matter of the M’Korio. A very
genuine interest had appeared in the old man’s
face whenever he discussed the history or the
geography of the M’Korio. There ran through
his character that tendency towards futile pottering
which led our grandfathers—with a mighty
empire before them—to waste their energies
upon the foundation of learned societies.
During those enormous dinners, where every
celebrity had elbowed him, Mr Burden had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
often given cause for the very gravest fears
to the more masterful mind of the leader. But
whenever he had an opportunity of discussing
Dr Mohl’s pamphlet with such experts as M.
Sabbat or Canon Cone, his animation and delight
relieved Mr Barnett’s apprehension. On
the famous night when the first of our geologists
maintained the undoubted presence of gold in
the M’Korio, and when, in the startled silence
that followed, Mr Barnett (smiling that famous
smile) had handed the model of the nugget
from guest to guest, Mr Burden, ignoring
all that the news portended for his country,
showed an excited interest in the unique
geological conditions which could produce
metallic deposits in a deep bed of decomposing
vegetable matter.</p>

<p>It was with confidence, therefore, that, on
the occasion of this great reception at Barnett
House, the host led Mr Burden proudly forward
to present him to Major Pondo, whose
book, “The African River,” had during the
past six days marked him out as the chief
expert upon that region.</p>

<p>The centre of every remark, the chief object of
every introduction throughout the evening, and
now, upon Mr Burden’s late arrival the natural
recipient of his views, Major Pondo was for the
moment one of the land marks of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>It was observed that Mr Burden stopped
somewhat suddenly, as in amazement, when
he approached the soldier; and, indeed, the
sight which met his gaze was novel to him,
and might have proved entrancing to a better
balanced mind.</p>

<p>Major Pondo, who boasted no regular commission
from any crowned head or president,
had yet perhaps seen more real fighting than
any of those who are pleased to call themselves
professional soldiers. Even in this
brilliant assembly, a dark contusion upon his
left cheek-bone was markedly visible, and a
deep gash, clumsily sewn up across the cusp
of the chin, marked an adventure suffered
somewhere far from medical aid. In stature,
he has been described as so short as to be
almost dwarfish. It is an error into which my
contemporaries have been led by the sturdy
build and short, strong neck of the explorer.
His exact height, as it appears in official
records, where the photograph, thumb-marks,
and many other accurate measurement of his
anatomy are preserved, is 1·3587 metres, or in
English notation, almost exactly five feet two
inches.</p>

</figure>

<p>Tropical suns and arctic snows in Mexico
and Manitoba had tanned his skin to the
colour of wet elm. His teeth were even and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>of a brilliant white, which stood in almost
painful relief against the complexion I have
described.</p>

<p>His head, which was of great size, was bald,
save for a considerable cluster of hair at the
back and just beside the ears. But though this
adornment was sparse, it was never unkempt;
and Mr Burden, while yet he was some way
off, could distinguish upon it the gloss of a
recent unguent. The scalp was a mighty
dome, and over the eyes was fixed a frown,
which indicated less a habit of scowling than
the fixed impression of indomitable energy.
The face was clean shaven, and the eyes of a
beautiful soft brown, approaching black. Their
glances were slow and measured, but seemed
to betray a certain unfamiliarity with his surroundings.
The right foot thrust out firmly
a few inches before the left; the right hand,
holding the coffee cup in a simple but powerful
gesture, the left clenched just above the small
of his back, such was the figure whose name
at least is familiar to every Englishman, such
was the human monolith which stood immovable
in the swirling of the throng as Mr
Burden approached it with wondering eyes.
Mr Barnett introduced and left them together.</p>

<p>In that introduction the explorer had bowed,
but had not uttered a word. To the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
remarks Mr Burden somewhat timidly made,
he replied with gestures alone; to a compliment,
with a slight smile; to a theory upon
the climate of the M’Korio valley, with a
cough that committed him to nothing.</p>

<p>My old friend has confessed to me that, for
some moments, he was in dread lest Major
Pondo might be dumb. He was even seized
with a terror that the man was ill-acquainted
with the English language, until the word
“Yas!” mouthed out in the rich accent of
Jamaica, convinced him that he was in error.
It was the prelude to a short account, delivered
as it were by rote, of the Major’s life and adventures,
at the close of which dark silence redescended.
Mr Burden, so far from finding
his suspicions allayed, was tortured with every
manner of doubt.</p>

<p>If it were my purpose to defend my friend,
I should find no difficulty in holding such a
brief. It must be remembered that he was
wholly ignorant of the new world into which
he had wandered, and that men such as Major
Pondo, or indeed any other of those who
yearly and almost daily spread the bounds of
our power, were quite unknown to him. His
irritability and unstable spirit, the result, as I
still believe, of old age, have been evident
throughout these pages, and it must be added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
that the hour was late—far later than the
merchant would have permitted himself had
he obeyed his medical adviser—that the glare,
the heat, the multitude, all combined to arouse
in him a morbid judgment, and to enflame
distorted views which were due in the main to
the failure of his health.</p>

<p>But it is not my business to defend him. I
have no duty but to enumerate quite simply, the
facts in their order. Were I to trespass upon
another ground, I might find myself in competition
with the labours of Mr and Mrs
O’Rourke, the very mention of whose existence
I particularly desire to avoid.</p>

<p>Be the cause what it may, when Mr Barnett
returned to lead Mr Burden to another guest,
so far from having brought my friend into
greater harmony with the astounding energies
of the new movement, he had produced, by
that interview with Major Pondo, a sentiment—I
repeat it, a morbid sentiment—approaching
disgust.</p>

<p>There was nothing which, at that moment,
Mr Burden would not have believed. There
was no anti-patriotic libel, no little-England
mania or lie, no dead and gone Cobdenism of
the sixties, which he would not have accepted
after that brief experience.</p>

<p>He left the house that night, full of a kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
of angry determination to go next day and do
what he had never yet dared to do: to speak
to Mr Abbott. But he would speak to him
in a sense very different from that which Mr
Barnett had intended when he had asked him
to call upon that life-long friend, and to offer
him a directorship.... He would see Abbott,
he would tell him of the risk to a considerable
fortune, of his doubts, of the torturing alternation
of his mind: he would find true stable
comradeship and relief.</p>

<p>Fate, and the nature of men, led on to their
meeting indeed, but brought it, in spite of
them both, to a very different end.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Mr Burden awoke next morning, the
deep sleep of fatigue and the good light of a
new day had somewhat changed his mood.
There remained of it nothing but an undercurrent
of anxiety, which the conversation of
Cosmo that morning did very much to allay.</p>

<p>The day’s business at the office was prosperous,
the air bracing and sunny; if he found
himself walking towards Mr Abbott’s office
that evening for the first time in so many weeks,
it was only because he was a business man,
trained to method, and that therefore he detested
to abandon any resolve he had formed.</p>

<p>He came severely, and with a purpose, into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the little panelled room which had seen for
123 years the growth of the Abbott Line.</p>

<p>The place reeked of our past; but there was
that in it which has justly provided the financial
press with a pet subject for ridicule. It was
as small as the cabin of a ship; indeed it had
sheltered three generations of men who had
sailed as owners perpetually in their own craft.
It suggested the punch and the tobacco of that
lazy race of seamen, who knew of nothing but
England, and cared for nothing but her; and
yet—in a way—we love them. It suggested
very primitive methods of business: phrases
about “The position of the house,” the plodding
and the short-sightedness of the men whose
theories in government and finance we have,
please God, finally abandoned. And at the
old large desk, in this old small room, sat a
figure most worthy of its frame.</p>

<p>Mr Abbot was in everything one of the
characters which, pleasing as they may still be
in fiction to-day, would be sand in the bearings
of England, ruining the machine, were they to
reappear in our modern life.</p>

<p>There was nothing in him of what a true
citizen has under the stress and vision of our
time.</p>

<p>He was tall, stout, and rubicund; his voice,
which was louder than that of a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
should be, pushed “cheeriness” up to and
beyond the bounds of vulgarity. The obstinacy
which his features partly betrayed was immediately
apparent when he began to discuss any
controversial matter. He was cocksure of this
and of that, upon twenty subjects where men
of an analytical power infinitely superior had,
in the vast intellectual expansion of these latter
years, been content to doubt or to criticise.</p>

<p>He was, in a word, what he would have
called “sound.” He was “sound” upon Free
Trade; he was “sound” upon the maintenance
of the gold standard—a matter upon which he
could know absolutely nothing. He was
“sound” in his contempt for “foreigners”—in
which category he was pleased to include
what he denominated “Yankees.” He loved
England—but what he loved was the soil,
the air, the habit; not that great vision we
possess. He clipped his words in a manner
so heartily unconscious and offensive that, for
all his great wealth, the entry into a rank above
that of his birth would have been denied him.
He did not attempt it.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_199fp" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_199fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“COMPETITION! SIR; COMPETITION!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To strangers he would come out with a great
roaring “sir,” at the end of every other sentence.
His conversations began with remarks
upon the weather (commonly in condemnation
of it) and would, I regret to say, not infrequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>terminate with an oath, as he expressed
his difference from the more modern
views of his companion. He would often
follow up such an expletive by uttering the
undoubted truth “that that was all <em>he</em> knew
about it,” or that “it was all <em>he</em> had to say.”</p>

<p>By some accident, probably of party tradition,
he had followed Mr Gladstone in his policy of
Home Rule for Ireland; but nothing save an
inexcusable mulishness had made him continue
to defend that worn-out error when all his
friends had abandoned it.</p>

<p>It is not remarkable that, with such a character,
he should have found himself totally out
of sympathy with the principal economic trend
of our time, and should have boldly refused to
amalgamate the Abbott Line with any combination
of shipowners. I can almost see him
as I write, sitting at the table at the Palmerston,
where he lunched, and shouting: “Competition,
sir, competition!” at the unhappy
Zachary K. Peabody, the agent of the African
Steamship Trust, whose refinement he was too
coarse to perceive, and whose practical experience
of commerce he derided.</p>

<p>His features were, in their outline, projecting
and masculine; his eyes firm, his chin solid.
His hair, which was always in disorder, was of
a sharp iron-grey, and two little whiskers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
nearly white, emphasised the squareness of his
face. But the strength of his mouth was
weakened by a perpetual tendency to laughter,
and what he would have called “good-fellowship,”
or, as I have heard it named, “Row.”</p>

<p>Many things had combined to give him his
influence over Mr Burden. They had been
young men together in the days when a
common label of so-called Liberalism, the
necessity for political effort, was sufficient to
mask many essential differences of character
between men. The greater vigour and more
sanguine temperament of the shipowner had
naturally over-borne the sobriety and occasional
hesitation of the dealer in hardware. It must
also be admitted, that in many of the small
affairs of life—a narrow life, remember, and one
whose horizon was easily surveyed—his judgment
had rarely been at fault. It was he who
had introduced Mr Burden to the trade in the
M’Korio, and who would willingly—for as such
crude natures often are, he was capable of
affection—have gone to any sacrifice to preserve
his friend from commercial or personal
dishonour.</p>

<p>He was unmarried.</p>

<p>As for his judgment upon any of the great
complexities of modern life, no worse judge
could have been discovered than this utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
simple, obstinate, loud-voiced man. His
judgment upon such an adventure as Mr
Barnett’s could hardly for a moment be in
doubt. Mr Burden had felt it instinctively,
and, for all these weeks, had carefully avoided
that familiar room. Now at last he entered;
but the very sight of Mr Abbott’s face roused
in him a kind of warning that a severe difference
of opinion might arise.</p>

<p>It will not surprise my readers to be told
that Mr Abbott’s greeting was emphatic and
commonplace, full of “eh’s?” and “Lord love
me’s,” and “all this long time’s”; but there
lay in it a kind of hint that Mr Abbott knew
well enough the cause which had so prolonged
that interval.</p>

<p>Natural as was hesitation to such a man
upon such a subject, Mr Burden looking first
in his friend’s eyes, and then away from them
to a vile oil painting of the <em>Arethusa</em>, said:</p>

<p>“Abbott, I have come to ask your advice
upon a matter ... or perhaps I should say,
I want to hear what you think of a matter....”</p>

<p>Mr Abbott replied that Mr Burden might
“ask away,” and “whatever you’re going to
do,” he continued, with a facile joviality, “take
my advice and don’t.” He laughed boisterously,
as is the fashion of such men, at his
own wit, blew his nose in a resounding way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
took out a pipe, filled it with an astonishing
black tobacco, lit it and said:</p>

<p>“Fire it out, my lad. Out with her!”</p>

<p>It was some time since Mr Burden had
suffered this kind of approach; and it cannot
be denied that he was more than a little
nettled. Perhaps he showed it in his tone.
At anyrate he said shortly enough:</p>

<p>“I have come to ask you what you think
of the M’Korio?”</p>

<p>“It stinks,” said Mr Abbott, decisively.</p>

<p>He shut his mouth upon the words like a
gin; put his hands firmly upon the desk, as
does a man upon a rudder bar, and looked up
at Mr Burden.</p>

<p>“Whole country stinks. You’ve known
places that stink. Barking Level stinks. Out
<em>there</em>, by God, the whole place stinks. Big as
Yorkshire—I’ve been there, mind you, and
you haven’t. Not a square yard but stinks!”</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr Abbott, in company with many
who declaim against the corruption of our
public life, would have done well to consider
whether his language was not a greater offence
against true morality than the actions and
motives which he so recklessly ascribed to
others.</p>

<p>“I came for advice, Abbott: not for abuse,”
said Mr Burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>He was thoroughly annoyed, and the whole
purpose of his visit receded from him. He
was annoyed by the self-satisfaction of his
friend’s tone, by the excessive coarseness of
his language, though it came from lips to
which, I fear, coarseness was habitual. And
he was, above all, annoyed to have thrust into
the delicacy of his slight scruples this roaring
objurgation.</p>

<p>“Who’s abusing you, man alive?” said Mr
Abbott, in his great loud voice, staring in
harmony with his tone.</p>

<p>Mr Burden, crossing his arms, and tapping
the oilcloth with his left foot, answered, with
quiet dignity, that Mr Abbott’s words implied
an insult to his friends, to himself, and he
might add, to the Empire.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott’s only reply was to draw his
forefinger rapidly across his nose—a gesture to
which he was most unfortunately addicted—to
clench his fist, and to strike the table before
him.</p>

<p>“The Empire?” said Mr Abbott, much as a
man might say, “the giant Blunderbore?”
Then he continued, more quietly: “Burden,
you’re going mad.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Empire,” said Mr Burden with
some heat, and with more decision than he
had yet shown. “I came for advice, Abbott,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and, upon my soul, I think I’m more fit to
give it you than you are to give it me.”</p>

<p>He had the firmness now to look Mr
Abbott straight in the eye, and doing so, he
said in a voice that was almost equally firm:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do not know that they have
found gold?”</p>

<p>“GOLD!” roared, bellowed, thundered
Mr Abbott. He blew out a great breath, and
whispered at the end of it: “Oh Lord in
heaven!”</p>

<p>Mr Burden could bear no more.</p>

<p>He got up and said: “I’m sorry for this,
Abbott, but I don’t think that either you or I
will profit by continuing the scene.”</p>

<p>Mr Abbott rose at the same time from his
big wooden chair.</p>

<p>“You may go if you like, Burden,” he said,
wagging his forefinger, and staring into his
friend’s face, as is the fashion of insolent men;
“you may go if you like ... but don’t blame
me if they knock you! They’re a lot of ——
scoundrels, and if you have anything to do
with them you’re a —— fool ... and remember
I said so. Don’t blame me if they
knock you!”</p>

<p>“I blame you for nothing but your expressions,
Abbott,” said Mr Burden.</p>

<p>His legs were trembling beneath him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
emotion; he repressed it, and walked slowly
to the door, which he was careful to shut
behind him with courteous ease.</p>

<p>When he was gone Mr Abbott, whose mind
was closed to all save the most immediate
things, stared at the door a moment, first
blankly, then a little sadly. At last he gave
an enormous cough, followed by a laugh yet
more enormous, and within ten minutes had
forgotten the scene in the intricacies of a policy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But Mr Burden was thoroughly disturbed.
He was the more hurt at his friend’s outburst,
because at heart he had been on the defensive.
Had Mr Abbott shown less violence, the
advice—which he had rejected—would perhaps
have sunk less deeply into his mind. As
it was, the effect of the quarrel was this: that
the wild words of Mr Abbott, the groundless
insinuations which were those (at the best) of
a fanatic, did more than the closest reason
could have done. They took root in his
heart, and bore a fruit of suspicion which
never left him night or day.</p>

<p>He dined in the evening in town, alone, at
an hotel—a thing he had not done for perhaps
ten years. He purposely remained in that
hotel for many hours, that he might be alone
when he should reach home, and that he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
sleep before the very name M’Korio should
reach his ears again. He took the 11.2, and
did not reach his station till twenty minutes to
twelve. It was close upon midnight when he
unlocked the door of Avonmore.</p>

<p>He saw lights and heard voices; he came
into the smoking-room whence they proceeded,
and saw at the fire the profile of Cosmo, a
little table with glasses, syphons and a whisky
bottle, and beyond them, in his own deep
padded chair, a cranium and a back which
were most certainly those of Mr Barnett: of
Mr Barnett in repose.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Mr Barnett did not rise.</p>

<p>He held between his hands such
“teeming destinies,” he controlled in the pursuit
of his high mission so many various men,
that his life necessarily suffered from the tension
of artificial effort.</p>

<p>He was the more inclined to relax upon
those occasions when he felt himself in the
presence of friends who were bound to him by
ties of gratitude. That evening in Norwood
such a temptation was enhanced by the influence
of a cosy room, soda water, spirits, a
deeply padded chair, two magazines, Scotch
whisky, and all the atmosphere of refinement.</p>

<p>He relaxed, I say, and a more truly lovable,
because a more real Mr Barnett shone outwards
through the surface of the man: a Mr
Barnett not anxious for his accent or any other
thing; a Mr Barnett interior, domestic, and
at ease.</p>

<p>In such a mood he saw no need to rise; but
his courtesy did not forsake him, nor the inbred
habit of a man of the world. He lifted himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
some inches from the chair by a pressure of
his left hand and stretched out his right
towards the owner of the house.</p>

<p>The high cosmopolitan sphere in which Mr
Barnett had been formed is naturally indifferent,
as our eager English gentry also are, to
the conventions of the suburbs; but my readers
will already have learnt that nothing could
offend Mr Burden more than a breach of the
usages of Norwood.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett’s attitude was at first incredible
to him: to this incredulity succeeded a burst
of anger.</p>

<p>The late hour, the recent quarrel with his
oldest friend, and, doubtless, the approach of
illness, might have betrayed Mr Burden into
an irrevocable step. He might have left the
room without speaking. He might even, so
thoroughly was he put out, have manœuvred
for his guest’s departure by that process of
persistent, patient pressure which is called
“kicking a man out of one’s house.” He
might have sworn—had not Cosmo, with an
excellent comprehension of his father’s petty
vagaries, saved the position.</p>

<p>For Cosmo stepped out to greet his father
warmly; he congratulated him heartily on
having been able to return in time; he told
the flurried merchant how long and anxiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
the financier had waited; with the pardonable
exaggeration of filial care, he ante-dated Mr
Barnett’s advent and his own by a little over
three hours; he insinuated in every tone that
nothing but the overwhelming importance of
his father’s judgment could have led Mr
Barnett to so great an effort.</p>

<p>Mr Burden was but partially appeased; he
sat down in a stiff chair, not his own, and faced
Mr Barnett sternly as one might a witness in
a court; the Leader of Men returned his gaze
with a beam of comatose good nature. His
head leaned slightly to the right, his upper
eyelids (which were double, as are those of
the great Andean bird) dropped deeply down,
but from the little slit of prominent eye beneath
a liquid humour still gleamed. That humour
played upon Mr Burden steadily for some
forty seconds, and then the voice spoke.</p>

<p>“I am ver’ happy to zee you, Mr Burten.”</p>

<p>A doubt, a disgusting suspicion, ran through
Mr Burden’s mind; it leapt into a formed
phrase; he felt the words coming—but it never
reached his lips. He controlled himself during
the pause that followed, and, during that pause,
it was most evident that Mr Barnett’s vast organising
mind was plunging deeper and deeper into
the baths of silence and recuperation.</p>

<p>When he spoke next, it was with eyes quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
shut, and head bending forward irregularly at
intervals.</p>

<p>“About that fellow Âppott?” he said.</p>

<p>Mr Burden did not answer.</p>

<p>“That fellow Âppott,” Mr Barnett’s big
head wagged slowly in disapproval, “he is
obstinate—but he is O.K. Alright. Aha?
Not so?” Mr Barnett groped with his right
hand as though to lay it upon Mr Burden’s
knee; but, finding in the way the arm of the
deep chair on which he sat, he patted that
affectionately instead, and closed his eyes
again, and was silent.</p>

<p>The younger and more active, though lesser,
mind of Cosmo, came to the aid of Mr Barnett,
whom fatigue, coupled with his remaining
difficulties in the English tongue, had led into
some vagueness of expression. Cosmo was
the better fitted to speak, from the fact that
Mr Barnett, earlier in the evening, when his
mood had been for some reason more sprightly,
had fully explained how and why Mr Abbott
was necessary to the M’Korio.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Cosmo, rapidly, “you know
how very few men there are in London who
know one subject; Mr Abbott really does
know the Delta. That is the whole point.
But I am not sure that Mr Barnett quite
understands....”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Mr Barnett smiled and grunted; he was
following, but indistinctly.</p>

<p>“Of course you know the difficulty, and I
suppose I know it too. It all comes from
what is finest in his nature; but the suspicion
is intolerable, father. And that is another
reason why he ought to come in.”</p>

<p>After this lucid sequence of ideas, Cosmo,
who was standing with his hand on the table
looking anxiously at his father across the
lamplight, said, with real earnestness, “We
<em>must</em> get him to come in.”</p>

<p>Mr Barnett opened his eyes rather widely
and suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>“Ah! Yes! He môst come in. That is so.”</p>

<p>He nodded wisely; then, had not breeding
forbidden him, he would have gone to sleep.</p>

<p>He fought against the temptation successfully,
straightened himself a little in his chair,
and pursued the attack upon Mr Burden in a
manner the efficiency of which was only
marred by his extreme drowsiness. There
was in his manner that which should connote
so high a respect for Mr Burden’s powers as
to permit of confidence. He leant forward
heavily and pressed his thumb against the
merchant’s ribs, not as do lighter men and
less consistent, with a jerk or dig, but with
a continuous pressure such as one uses against
an electric bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>When he had done this, Mr Barnett said,
with increasing wakefulness, and a kind of
mock sadness in his voice:</p>

<p>“Sômetimes they do nôt come in....
No? ... Then we ...” And Mr Barnett
made with the thumb and forefinger of his
right hand a peculiar screwing motion, a
gesture native to the conqueror; having done
so, he concluded: “we môst use pres-sure,”
and, as he said these words, he got up and
stood steadily upon his feet.</p>

<p>It was a thing remarkable and arresting to
the eye to see the fumes of lethargy pass from
that great mind as mist does from the face of
a mountain at morning; by an effort of the
will it had thrown off sleep and the blessing of
repose. The power of concentration had returned
with every word during the last five
minutes; the accent had grown purer; the
attention more decisive. Mr Barnett noted
the hour, he noted the cast of Mr Burden’s
face in the shade of the light, and interpreted
it to mean a comprehension of his scheme.
He exaggerated, I believe, the intelligence of
his host and colleague.</p>

<p>He took his hat from the table and put it
firmly and ceremoniously upon his head, as
was his custom before he left a room; he took
up his cane, the top of which was of lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
covered with gold; he buttoned round him a
great coat of fur, and, being so prepared, went
out through the drawing-room into the hall.
There, with great emphasis, he said good-night.</p>

<p>Cosmo not only opened the door for him,
but leant his right hand upon his shoulder, to
afford support to a man older and perhaps more
infirm than himself. He so supporting him,
they went down the drive together, to where,
at the gate, stood the electric brougham, throwing
great cones of light upon the thick air of
the small hours: it was the first in London to
bear upon its panels a small coat of arms.</p>

<p>As they went, Mr Barnett spoke twice. The
first thing he said was: “You should have a
drive up herein. So a carriage can come.
There is no good if a carriage cannot come.”
When he had said this, some rapid process of
thought led him to another topic, and he continued:
“Your father is a very fônny man.”</p>

<p>Cosmo although he had received so much
wider a training than his father, retained a
trace, perhaps hereditary, of those conventions
which I have already condemned. He felt the
colour come into his face; but the darkness
screened him, and his knowledge of the world
restored him his balance in a moment.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right,” he said cheerfully. He
opened the carriage door (not without the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
thanks of his chief) and tenderly arranged a
warm rug around Mr Barnett’s knees. The
young man in livery, hired for such purposes,
stood by in somnolent respect. Then they
bade each other good-night, and the last word
Cosmo heard that evening as he turned back
towards the house was the great and comforting
word “Hôme,” rolled out by Mr Barnett
to his servant in the accent of command.</p>

<p>When Cosmo had re-entered the house and
approached, with great reluctance, the room
whose atmosphere still seemed full of failure,
he found that his father had gone to bed, and
he was glad; for, like most men possessed of
wisdom, he trusted half his fortunes to the
influence of other men’s sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If the effect of a misunderstanding or a
quarrel were immediate, with what rapidity
would not the tragedies of the world develop!
With what certitude could one not foresee, and
perhaps provide against, the climax of an evil
fortune.</p>

<p>If things led on from logical step to step,
what simple stories would crowd the world.
Then indeed the epic and the lyrical, which we
perpetually seek in fiction, would divert us in
the common affairs of our own lives.</p>

<p>But the real world around us, the world one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
corner of which it is here my business to describe,
is not arranged in that fashion. A
crime, a miscalculation, will produce consequences,
not immediate but ultimate. Suspicions
confirmed, quarrels brought perhaps to
the point of violence, seem rather to sink into
the mind and to make a soil there, than to bear
their full fruit at once; so that, when the catastrophe
falls, it is commonly at an insignificant
and nearly always at an unsuspected moment.</p>

<p>So it was with what I can only call the
tragedy of my friend.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that when his even, narrow,
and placid mind should finally come face to
face with the broad and rugged power of Mr
Barnett, sharp pain, and possibly misfortune,
should follow from such a meeting. The unhappy
accident of the visit to Mr Abbott, and
of a couple of hours delay, had brought those
two minds in the presence one of the other;
and a very grave hour had passed. But so are
men made, that this experience led to nothing
at the time. A night’s long sleep, the activities
of the following day, sufficed to blur the
image. Is it not Seneca who tells us that our
own judgment is qualified by the expressed
judgment of others? The public character of
Mr Barnett recovered its place in Mr Burden’s
mind. Many days at his business, a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
change in the weather, a small but lucky investment,
a very active quarrel with his cook,
who demanded and received instant dismissal—these
good and evil things soon put the misfortune
of Mr Barnett’s visit into its true perspective.
It produced no visible, certainly no
deplorable, result; what it did do was to leave
Mr Burden all ready for further irritation, and
for a growing misconception of his surroundings,
until at last the great misfortune fell,
after apparently the most trivial of accidents.
The heart of his confidence had been eaten out;
it held by the outer shell alone, and a touch
was enough to make it crumble. But, for the
moment, his faith held firm.</p>

<p>Moreover, if Mr Burden had been inclined
to let the incident weigh upon him Cosmo’s
efforts alone would have dispersed such an
inclination. He returned home quite regularly
day after day; he entertained his father with a
thousand things. It was not till a week had
passed that he permitted so much as a letter
concerning the affairs of the Company to come
under the old man’s eyes. When such a letter
did arrive, he had carefully provided that it
should be a short note of congratulation from
a country gentleman, a distant acquaintance, a
man of great possessions, wholly ignorant of
the Delta and of most other things; one that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
hoped, if all went well, to be a shareholder,
and who very warmly said so in his letter to
Norwood.</p>

<p>At intervals of several days business details,
of no great importance, but such as gradually
reawakened in Mr Burden the old interest,
began to come to his table; later he dined
with Mr Harbury and met a very charming
American actress, the manager of the Banque
des Pyrénées, Lord John Mackintosh and his
wife, and Lothingbury Grail, a gentleman who
had written verses. They talked of Art.</p>

<p>A week later Cosmo and he lunched with
Lord Benthorpe at Cosmo’s club, and the very
next day, walking in the best of moods towards
the City, they met by accident Mr Barnett himself,
fresh with the morning, and in the most
sympathetic of moods.</p>

<p>And all this while around Mr Burden, in the
papers, in the conversation of men, the M’Korio
grew and grew. The season continued, the
debates in Parliament languished, the heat increased,
and the spirit of the great African
River ran through the veins of London.</p>

<p>The prospectus was drafted: many little
inconclusive conversations were held; in a
word, by all those small preliminaries which
are necessary to a great and worthy enterprise,
Mr Burden was re-introduced to the routine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
he knew. His active interest returned. But
deeper down the pall lay over his mind, and
could not be lifted.</p>

<p>The struggle between these two things, his
fatal lack of comprehension, his eager and
patriotic pride, has been hitherto the matter
of my record. Alas! the victory of the former
must now lead on to my conclusion!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr Burden permitted his colleagues to undertake
the necessary details, and he was even
glad that they should look after such wearisome
business. The registration of the Company,
the finding of Brokers for it, and of
Bankers, and of Solicitors, would have interfered
with what he honestly believed to be his own
engrossing labours in connection with his trade.</p>

<p>He was profoundly thankful that no further
word was spoken of Mr Abbott; but it was
the thankfulness of respite, not of reprieve.
He saw before him an inevitable day, and he
dreaded it. He consoled himself with guesses;
he tried to forget that his great friendship
had turned into an instrument—an instrument
which could wound as well as work for him.</p>

<p>Eddies of uncertainty swirled in his mind.
The Bankers were as firm as the Bank of
England, the Brokers were of immense respectability,
the very name of the Solicitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
seemed like a part of the Constitution; but
all these things did but increase his disease—they
seemed to him to be at the same time
England, and not England. It was as though
a man should be given a picture framed in a
solid familiar frame—a frame suited to hold
the portrait of his father—and hung before his
table; and as though, in such a setting, the
picture within constantly shifted and changed,
now terrifying, now evil, now grotesque, now
merely irritant, but always a nightmare of
discord. In this mood a critical day found him—the
day when his presence in the new offices
was demanded to hear the prospectus read, and
to pass it finally for printing.</p>

<p>The new offices were in Broad Street. Their
position I have described in an earlier part of
this book; with their magnificence perhaps
most of my readers are acquainted. I have
but to recall the two plaster lions that guard
the staircase, symbolising, it is believed, the
majesty of our race; the splendid negro, in
Vienna ware of life-size, holding the lamp in
the central gallery, and clothed as to his middle
with a belt of ostrich feathers—whose ring of
white against the shining darkness of his skin
naturally led on to the row of smiling teeth
above and the very conspicuous eyes. This
masterpiece, which Mr Barnett had accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
long ago in lieu of payment of a debt, was
already familiar to London—little reproductions
of it were to be seen in the shops of the
West End—the symbols of the M’Korio. The
interiors were worthy of such apparatus. The
doors of the main rooms were of oak; the doorplates
and the locks were Marie Antoinette
bronze gilding, embossed, single and reversible.
It was a matter of pride to the Promoters that
no two were exactly alike. A large male black
cat, bearing round its neck a silver collar, added
the note of domesticity, and was already familiar
to Britain through the personal paragraphs of
the daily press. The whole was rendered complete
by a porter, than whom nothing more
splendid could serve a sovereign in arms,
whether in London or Berlin.</p>

(FROM A GROUP)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This man was a Swedish Protestant; in
height he was fully six feet seven, his hair was
of the colour of tow, his eyes were of a faded
blue, his face was white and yellow; in intellect,
while not deficient, he was of a deliberation
which admirably suited the nature
of his employment; nor could any length of
hours passed in the public gaze at the Main
Entrance weary the Northern steadfastness of
his mind. Proud of his uniform, content with
his wages, enormous in his manner as in his
dimensions, he was a further and a crowning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>proof of Mr Barnett’s instinct for what those
adjuncts are, which cheer on to success the
energies of an Imperial race.</p>

<p>I would I had the space or leisure to deal at
further length with this remarkable and simple
figure; indeed, long before Mr Burden’s death,
it was my intention to devote to the portrayal
of this porter’s life and character that literary
skill which has now been turned into another,
a far graver, and I fear a more monotonous
channel. I had intended to relate exactly his
career. How, stranded in the docks of London,
this towering Scandinavian had obtained employment
as a Life-guard; how, deserting from
his Corps on account of the bullying to which he
was subjected by his comrades, he found his
way into the Metropolitan Police. Dismissed
from this force for drunkenness, he became a
chucker-out in a Music Hall, in which post
his grievous muscular weakness, universal in
men of his type, soon proved him unfit to deal
with that athletic youth which frequents such
haunts in the hey-day of its vigour; how,
finally, while posing as a giant in a Fair, a
position he occupied in return for his bare
food, he was tempted to break his contract at
the prospect of a higher wage. At the persuasion
of Mr Barnett himself, he fled by
night, accepted the service and livery of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
M’Korio, and so reached the culmination of
his career.</p>

<p>His interesting personality has detained my
pen too long, I must return to Mr Burden
entering the Great Room, where he should
find his colleagues on the day when the Prospectus
in its final form was to be passed for
Press.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr Burden had played a great part in the
world. He had been Sheriff in the early
eighties; he had been Treasurer to the Bowmakers’
Company, and had drawn up in that
capacity the scheme for endowing a new Chair
of Comparative Religion at Dublin, a city
sadly in need of broadening its outlook upon
God; he had been called as an honoured
witness before many Royal Commissions, and
had sat on the Committee for the Adjustment
of Port Dues; he had even enjoyed, now for
some years, the honourable title of Justice of
the Peace; and on the occasion of the Mansion
House dinner, but eight months before, he
had sat between the Chancellor of the Exchequer
of the moment and some other
member of the Cabinet whose name I cannot
recall.</p>

<p>He was therefore not unfamiliar with the
honourable pomp wherewith we surround the
conduct of Empire; he was accustomed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
scenes and the personalities which accompany
the furtherance of our Fate.</p>

<p>As he had entered daily deeper and deeper into
the machinery by which that fate is advanced,
its complexity had overwhelmed his simple mind.</p>

<p>I have sufficiently described the vortex of
conflicting moods into which his soul had been
drawn; yet must that whirlpool continually
appear in this short story of his end, for without
some sympathy with his grievous torment
a view quite false to his nature might be conveyed.
He could not comprehend.</p>

<p>It must be so. The past and the name of
such men are necessary to the grist of expansion;
but expansion and the newer kind of responsibilities
kill them. So doubtless Venice in
the sixteenth, Spain in the seventeenth, Holland
in the eighteenth centuries were compelled to
use, and destroy in using, what had been their
most national type. It was the price they paid
for the varied glory they proceeded to achieve.
My friend was a necessary sacrifice, I know;
but he was my friend. The victim moves me.</p>

<p>Consider him here in this great modern room—how
much it was a torture-place for him.</p>

<p>He and they were ending their work. That
day the last stone would be laid; yet was he
further than ever from repose.</p>

<p>He and the three other men before him were
now occupied in the actual work of forging a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
new province. The dignity of such an occasion
should have touched him (he thought)
more profoundly than it could his colleagues,
whose lives had been spent in no other atmosphere.
But, alas! unrest, most cogent, most
bewildering, robbed that great occasion of any
note of the solemn. Reality and unreality
mixed in his mind continually. The world,
so long a quite familiar thing, grew unfamiliar
to him, more and more with every hour. The
constraint which he felt in Mr Barnett’s presence;
the certitude he had that Mr Barnett
was a genius and a maker of England;
the natural awe wherewith he regarded
Lord Benthorpe’s experience; the astonishing
phenomenon whereby Lord Benthorpe
nevertheless showed himself purely passive;
Harbury’s manifestly clear and decisive intelligence,
coupled with his complete subservience—all
these contradictions put his
mind into a whirl.</p>

<p>Full of an aged complaint, not very distant
from despair, he sat him down wearily in the
vacant chair set for him. It was of the kind
known to the trade as “Dutch Mediæval
Easy”; fashioned of American hickory so
treated as to resemble old English oak, and
handsomely upholstered in a green imitation
of Spanish leather.</p>

<p>He noticed Mr Harbury’s quiet, impressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
face; Lord Benthorpe’s somewhat nervous
ease; above all, Mr Barnett’s powerful ill-dressed
figure, sitting at random, bent over
the scattered papers before him; and in his
heart he groaned, remembering his fortune
risked, the friendship of his life in jeopardy,
and his hopeless see-saw of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>As usual, it was Mr Harbury who spoke
first; as usual, he spoke rapidly and clearly.</p>

<p>“I think, gentlemen,” he said, “there is
very little for us to do ... Payleys will bank
for us, as you know. Charles &amp; Charles will
naturally do our legal work. The Directors
I think we know.” He smiled as he said this,
a slight conventional smile which fluttered on
the face of Lord Benthorpe, and died on that
of Mr Burden. “All we have to do is to read
over the prospectus for the last time.” He
sighed, and there was a pause. Then he
turned to Mr Burden, saying: “Perhaps Mr
Burden can suggest something.”</p>

<p>Mr Burden frowned solemnly. How often
at his breakfast-table, when he opened his
morning’s letters, had he not come upon such
documents, prospectuses—the bricks and stones
of Dominion? How often had he not held
them before him, judging them steadily through
his spectacles of gold? How rarely had he
been misled by the false; how rarely had he
despised the true? His investments had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
been many. The expansion of his business had
absorbed the greater part of his savings. But
such ventures as he had made were safe
enough. He could remember but one that
had failed, and that was through no fault of
his own judgment, or of that of his directorate.
It was the Foreign Office which, as usual, had
failed to put its foot down, and had permitted
the ruffianly Alemami of Yollabù to repudiate
his most solemn engagements. On all these
things Mr Burden pondered in a confused
silence; then he said, in that measured tone
which marks the man of affairs:</p>

<p>“I can remember nothing that needs alteration,
Mr Harbury; nothing material.”</p>

<p>Mr Harbury suggested that they should
read the draft of the prospectus immediately,
and that if anything occurred to any of them
for the last time he should mention it.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury had not got very far into the
body of the work when Lord Benthorpe
stopped him at the word “exploitation.” It
seemed to him a foreign word, and it had a
flavour of something grasping and unjust about
it. He hoped that no atmosphere of that
kind would mar the effect of the prospectus.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury was evidently interested, and
asked Mr Burden’s opinion. Mr Burden, who
had been lost in thought, gazing at the great
map of the M’Korio Delta that hung on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
wall, patched with yellow for gold and with
grey for coal, looked round somewhat flurried,
and said that he had nothing to say.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe suggested the word “development,”
but Mr Harbury pointed out that
the word already occurred at the head of the
sheet in the phrase “M’Korio Delta Development
Company.”</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe murmured:</p>

<p>“True, true.”</p>

<p>After about ten minutes of discussion, the
word “exploitation” was allowed to stand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such are the limits of a modern book, that
it is impossible for me to give at full length
every remark that was made during this historic
meeting. I abandon the attempt with
reluctance. So many subtle shades of meaning
were thrashed out between these four men;
so powerfully did their various characters come
into play; so many aspects of the forces that
build up new colonies appeared in them, that
the subject possesses an irresistible fascination
to the writer, and perhaps to the reader of this
chronicle. It is a fascination which they must
resist: each in his own sphere.</p>

<p>Briefly, then, to mention only the more
important matters, the word “but” in the fifth
line was changed to “and”; the Anglo-Saxon
word “employee” was substituted for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
printer’s “employé”; and (a very striking
example of Mr Barnett’s grasp of the public
pulse), the word “lagoon” (though it had
become familiar to the Island race in the last
two months) was changed to “lake.”</p>

<p>The whole discussion did not absorb more
than an hour and a half of their time; and, at
the close of it, Mr Barnett rang for a servant.
He was that man of magnificence whom we
have seen: a giant amenable and of service,
he brought in wine and sandwiches upon a
tray. The four men ate and drank, relaxing
for a moment their attention to business, and
touching upon lighter things. Three-quarters
of an hour was all that Mr Barnett allowed for
this pleasant interval: he rang again, and their
discussion was resumed. They went carefully
over all the points which had previously been
decided, deleted a comma after the words
“brightest gem,” and put a full stop after “in
the British crown.”</p>

<p>At last, as the afternoon was drawing on,
one or the other would rise at intervals, stroll
to the window with his hands in his pockets
and gaze out, or saunter to the fireplace, and
lean upon the mantel-piece looking into the
glass above it. Conversation of a more general
kind occasionally relieved the strain and tension
of their great task. Lord Benthorpe had
quite an interesting argument with Mr Harbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
upon the value of the inter-colonial postal
system, and Mr Burden slept, for perhaps five or
six minutes, towards the close of the afternoon.</p>

<p>By four o’clock, however, there remained
nothing to decide, and Mr Barnett suggested
that he himself should read over the prospectus
for the last time, that they might have a final
opportunity of touching upon any matters that
had not hitherto occurred to them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Outside in Broad Street, men passed and
repassed, and most of them glanced up at that
great window. There were many of the
shrewdest, and many of the most solid, who
envied the little group within; and even the
great run of people, the crowd which turns the
curving lane to a river through the middle
hours of the day, felt the magic of what was
passing behind those walls.</p>

<p>There were some random enthusiasts—vague,
belated democrats from an earlier age—who
were filled with sudden anger as they
considered invincible powers of evil forging, in
that room above, the chains which were to bind
a new country. To these the names of
Benthorpe and Burden were the names of
implacable fiends; oppressors of humanity,
but oppressors of such more than human
genius, that humanity could do nothing against
their power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>On the top of a passing omnibus a father of
the name of Bailey, said to his son, who sat
beside him:</p>

<p>“You see that window? Those are the
M’Korio offices.”</p>

<p>He wagged his head wisely and said:</p>

<p>“It’s a big thing,” and the expression upon
his face was at once illuminate and reverent;
that of a familiar but devoted worshipper at
the shrine of some god. The boy, careless as
all boys are of all religions, said, “Oh,” and
the ’bus rolled on.</p>

<p>Even the policemen and other poor men,
who might have no share in these high things,
felt the awe of what was toward. The hawkers
and the newspaper boys, members of a rank
where finance is forgotten, yet remembered
England, and felt a pride of their own in
the venture upon which these four men had
entered; nor is there to-day any great city in
the world, save London, where every citizen
can forget envy and the differences of wealth
in the passion of patriotism.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile Mr Barnett, within, was reading
the prospectus for the last, and, if I remember
rightly, the fifth time.</p>

<p>He held the paper down on the table by
the weight of his large left hand, and read it
through most carefully; the volume of his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
was emphasised by the slight guttural accent
and the broad vowels which alone betrayed his
foreign experience.</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of his—common to most
men of dominant character—that he suffered
no interruption: a chance remark from Mr
Harbury, an interjection from Lord Benthorpe
passed by totally unheeded. His voice, slowly
proceeding from word to word, or jolting at the
stops, went steadily over the other men’s remarks,
and crushed them as a great stone
roller crushes clods in its going. It had also
this in common with the roller, that its pace
was even. He emphasised no syllables; every
letter—contrary to our modern English usage—was
pronounced; and this, in words such as
“undesirability,” “advantageous,” or “irrecognisable”
produced an effect both rich and
strange.</p>

<p>When he had finished reading, he smoothed
the papers out, gathered them up, and sighed
as over a thing completed. He rose, and the
three others with him; and you may say that
one of the greatest days in the recent history
of our country had gloriously ended.</p>

<p>“Not once or twice,” as someone says somewhere,
“in our rough island story, the path of
duty was the road to glory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">There runs a mandate to chosen nations
to govern upon earth as vicegerents of
the Divine. It has fallen upon peoples so
separated by time and customs that its essential
unity is with difficulty perceived; nevertheless,
that unity is assured. The process whereby
dominion is achieved is called by different
names: the names, and not the events, deceive
us; the names alone produce a false atmosphere
of change. First, perhaps, it was the vague
loyalty to the tribe, the marauding foray, the
settlement; next the intense love of a city and
of its gods, the successful defence, the advance,
the conquest and organisation of lands beyond
the boundary. Karl Unterwassen reverses the
order; it is a point of small importance.</p>

<p>To-day the registration of the Company, the
lease of offices, the prospectus, the flotation are
the progressive revelations of such a mandate.
Of all these allotment is the Crown.</p>

<p>The M’Korio Delta Development Company
opened its lists on the 9th of July. By four
o’clock of the 10th those lists were closed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
the capital had been subscribed; it is not
known how many times over.</p>

<p>With the next day the allotment began.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those of my fellow citizens who have been
engaged in the active work of Empire building,
will know what I mean when I say that allotment
is among the hardest tasks which our
country demands of us. Those who have not
been thus actively engaged in the expansion of
our civilisation (“they also serve who only
stand and wait”) must take it for granted.</p>

<p>Consider the care and judgment to be exercised!
Not to disappoint what is influential
or what is strong: not to alienate the mass of
small subscribers—for the mass of small subscribers
is Public Opinion. Not to offend the
proprietor of a great newspaper. Yet also,
not to offend the manager, the editor—sometimes
the papermaker. To consider the claims
which good birth and a long tradition of government
will give to this man, a genius for affairs
to that. To remember (and sometimes it is
only remembered at the last moment) that
such and such a name—almost passed over
in its insignificance—stands for another much
greater name. To recollect the power of
this subscriber with men of his own religion,
of this other with men who cultivate honesty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
of a third with those who admire the capacity
for intrigue. Monarchy must be remembered:
it is a permanent feature in our English life.
The army must be remembered. Politicians,
some of whose names the public will ignore,
must yet be accurately gauged. Their power
as managers and leaders must be estimated.
Even the foreigner must have his place, and
must be known. The foreign sovereign, the
foreign negotiator, may help to wreck or to
make the thing. He may be turned from the
ally to the enemy of our beloved country by
one involuntary error.</p>

<p>It is a task, I say, of awful responsibility,
and one in which a man may do more in a few
moments to advance or retard the designs of
Providence than in any other of the modern
world.</p>

<p>The work went on. Three hours of it, four
hours, sometimes five. On the second day Mr
Burden nearly broke down, Lord Benthorpe
was actually absent for two days running,
fallen ill from sheer fatigue. It told even upon
Mr Harbury. He got black patches under his
eyes, and he walked, a new thing for him, with
some fatigue. Mr Barnett alone seemed to be
actually refreshed by the closeness of application
that was necessary.</p>

<p>The public outside grumbled; nothing could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
be done till the allotment was declared. They
would have grumbled less had they seen the
grinding work of those ten days. Every
morning the mass of letters was sorted, the
list of names drawn up, and with strict commercial
probity every single application passed
before each of the directors.</p>

<p>On the fifth day Mr Burden’s head was lost,
and Lord Benthorpe’s assent had become
mechanical. Mr Barnett, on the contrary,
became more and more eager, more and more
exact as the work proceeded. Before the close
of the sixth day, his brain alone was sitting in
judgment over that mass of papers; it was
fortunate, for on the remaining four days the
most delicate part of the work remained to be
done. There did indeed pass by Mr Burden
one or two incongruous things that troubled
him. Canon Cone had sent no cheque. Mr
Barnett would make himself responsible for
that. Major Pondo, whom Mr Burden had
always regarded as a poor, adventurous man,
applied for fifteen thousand shares. The
secretary of that politician who had most consistently
denounced the financial side of our
colonial expansion applied for ten thousand.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen incidents of
this sort which Mr Burden could not fit in with
what he had known of the world. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
work was too pressing and too exacting to
leave energy for comment, or even for hesitation.
All these discrepancies made upon Mr
Burden’s mind only one general and blurred
effect: to wit, that his own judgment was
doubtful, and that society around him was
more complex, and perhaps more perilous,
than he had imagined.</p>

<p>On the 19th the allotment was declared.
On the morning of the 21st, though no sales
had taken place, the anxious informal bidding,
which went on in the house, and afterwards
in the street, and even privately between individuals
(rigorously as etiquette forbids such
things) was offering two and one-sixteenth, two
and one-eighth, two and a quarter before evening.
The prices began to be talked of, and
the selling to be regular within three days;
and the price then was over four. The shares
rose with the steady movement of a balloon,
up on an accelerating curve; “M. D. D.’s.”
changing hands with such rapidity, that it was
no longer possible to come to any conclusion
with regard to the individual motives of the
more important buyers and sellers. The pace
was the pace of a crusade. As religions take
men or the enthusiasms of war, so the public
had come to believe in themselves and the
M’Korio; in what they could <em>do</em> with the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
province. They saw the Delta already drained,
already mined—as it will be mined and drained—they
saw that the nominal capital of this
new company was the petty ransom of a great
kingdom in the future of England. By Wednesday,
the 26th, the shares were at seven.</p>

<p>It is the most fruitful and the most beneficent
of exaltations. It bridges the ford, as
Kipling has so finely said; it imposes law;
it is creating a new and happy world from the
west of Ireland to Pùtti-Ghâl. There is
something awful and mysterious about it. As
it sweeps by, this missionary creed, this determination
and confidence of a whole people, a
plain man’s spirit feeling it comes very near
to the Hosts of the Lord. On Monday the
31st, the shares were at eight and a quarter,
and there they stopped, up, poised upon a
summit, as genius poises upon the columns of
conquerors: hovering in bronze.</p>

<p>It is not in humanity—even in ours—to bear
these moods for ever undisturbed. Some
moments of doubt, but not of despair—perhaps
it is juster to say some moments of
repose will overtake the temper of the firmest
race. On Tuesday, the 1st of September, the
shares were at six and three-quarters. On
Thursday, the 3rd, they were a fraction below
five. But something rallied in the soul of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
England; the country clergy read in the
<cite>Standard</cite> of Saturday morning with something
of the throb a trumpet peal evokes, that
M.D.D.’s had gone ’way up over seven at
the close of the yesterday’s market.</p>

<p>By what avenue shall I approach the
analysis of that vast agglomeration of subconscious
national forces? Any single method
seems crude and petty in the presence of such a
complex and Overpowering Whole ... perhaps
it is most reasonable to follow the fortunes of
one block of shares. For, when great states
are fermenting towards ripeness, men are but
atoms whirled hither and thither. Economic
necessities drive them, and these necessities
in their turn are but the expression of some
historic will.... Yes, it is better to follow
the fortunes of a block of shares than of an
individual shareholder: for men pass, but the
Company remains....</p>

<p>I will consider the one thousand shares
originally allotted to the first cousin of the
Secretary for the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>He became the possessor of these upon the
19th, and had paid for them £250; £250
more to be paid (as the prospectus directed)
in three months, and the remainder when
called for. These were but a part of his holding;
but I am dealing with this one block of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
shares for the sake of example. On the 23rd,
I find them bought at the price of three and a
quarter by the Bishop of Ballycannon. On
the 26th, his lordship sells them at seven to
young Lord Berpham, who had been advised
by his solicitor that they were a good thing:
sincere advice, for his solicitor was also his
creditor and trustee. On the 31st, when they
touched eight and a quarter, Lord Berpham
should have sold, but that young disdainful
spirit was too noble. He was too noble. Had
he sold, he would have realised no less a sum
than £8250 (less brokerage). He was too
noble. The blood in him was confident of
England, and he held on for a rise. My
readers know what followed. The next day
they had fallen to six and three quarters. On
Thursday, most reluctantly, by the advice, not
to say the pressure, of his solicitors, the young
man sold at four and seven-eighths, having
lost no less a sum than £2100, which he could
ill afford. The buyer was Mr Zimmer, the
broker, but as I find that Mr Barnett himself
acquired them in the same afternoon, I have
no doubt that he was the bona fide purchaser;
my certitude becomes the more fixed when I
find that on Saturday morning, the 5th of
September (the shares having then touched
seven and a half), Mr Barnett disposed of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
to Henry Bowling, the well-known trainer and
proprietor of <cite>English Racing</cite>. He, in his turn,
sold them at the same price to Mrs Maidstone,
who disposed of them a fortnight later at the
same price to her sister-in-law, who sold them
at a slight premium in the open market. I
see them receding into the distance, passing
through the hands of that fine old poet-patriot,
Gaystone; then, a wofully disintegrated, a
mournful procession, as the winter wanes,
they drift off into the middle classes, sink,
and are engulfed.</p>

<p>But Mr Burden, he neither bought nor sold.
He was astounded at these fluctuations, but
more astounded at the permanently high level
which M.D.D.’s maintained, in spite of the
rough sea upon which they were tossed.
Sudden fortunes sprang around him, sudden
reputations startled and but half convinced his
sober mind. Even that Major Pondo, whose
face he thought he must have seen in dreams,
was wealthy now, and met him with an easy air.</p>

<p>Then it was, after a month of so much
violence, that the old man’s inner spirit, no
longer confused or troubled, leant towards its
end, and was possessed by sadness continually.</p>

<p>One part of it, the strongest and the safest,
the part that had so sanely judged his people
and their politics for fifteen years, still dwindled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>That other, older part, was not so easily to
be silenced, nor was so readily content. Here
suspicions had hardened (vain imaginary suspicions
without proof, born of a narrow knowledge
and of an ignorance of modern things)
till they became like thorns, piercing him.
He began to notice every gesture, and the
shifting of every eye. He would talk to
Cosmo more than Cosmo wished. Once or
twice he walked alone, and to no purpose,
southward out of Norwood, until he could
find the fields. Once, all night, he lay awake.
There was no pain, but he met the next day
in a spirit of awful tension, akin to madness.
Once he refused, for the first time, an invitation
to Mr Barnett’s house.</p>

<p>In such a mood he wasted his last midsummer.
In such a mood death, which needs
all our preparation, found him not half prepared.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To return to Mr Abbott.</p>

<p>His name had not been mentioned for days
and weeks, partly, of course, because every
guide in this adventure, from Cosmo to Mr
Barnett, was determined to give as little pain
as might be to Mr Burden, the oldest and
weakest of their number; and partly also
because the giving of that pain (in itself,
after all, only an imaginary evil), might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
result in the most practical of evils to the
M’Korio.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott was best as a friend, nay, as a
director; next best as an enemy; but worst of
all, as one neither enemy nor friend, but
contemptuous and perhaps influencing secretly
a member of their own group. They knew
all this, and July had ended without a word
being said. Mr Abbott himself had neither
spoken nor written; Mr Burden had not approached
the offices of the shipmaster. Mr
Barnett and Cosmo were both confident that he
dreaded the road to that familiar room; they were
confident he had not met his friend. Nor had he.</p>

<p>On the other hand, neither was the younger
nor the older of these two active brains willing
to temporise. It was not in their sound
scheme of business to temporise, and the
moment seemed to them, of all moments, the
least fitting for delay.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott pressed.</p>

<p>The session was lagging to its end. Within
a week or two the grouse would be whirring,
and the chance would come for the transference
of the M’Korio from the Government of
the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial; the
moment approached when a few men, undisturbed
by the necessities or accidents of
debate, could go right forward and do their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
best for England. But if time was propitious,
time also urged them. Soon the
great editors would have left their offices,
the heads of the great businesses would be
abroad or in the provinces. I have already
alluded to the grouse; but a very few weeks
and the shadow of the partridge would appear
between Mr Barnett and the best laid of his
plans. Already multitudes of the middle class
were asleep upon beaches of sand. Anxiety,
a mood that cannot long disturb such minds,
had begun to cast a wing over Mr Barnett’s
clear and creative intelligence.</p>

<p>The necessity for Mr Abbott was clamorous.</p>

<p>It was not only as a principal authority with
men as ordinary as himself (and such men are
often possessed of great influence or wealth;
sometimes of a voice in Parliament); it was
not only as a loud name, which the public had
long connected with the M’Korio Delta, nor
only as the owner of the Abbott Line, that Mr
Abbott’s support was demanded in Broad
Street. There were a number of other considerations,
each apparently of little importance,
but forming in the aggregate a strand which
men like Mr Barnett are the last to neglect.</p>

<p>Bowley depended more perhaps upon
Abbott’s general judgment of affairs than
upon any other’s man’s: and Bowley controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
the two groups of insurance which the
M’Korio coast still had to reckon with.</p>

<p>A friendship, a trifle fantastic, was to
be discovered between Abbott and the Permanent
Under-secretary for Malarial Districts.
That in itself might have been of
little importance a month earlier; but, with
Lord Malham at the Malarial Office, it made a
difference; he had only been there three weeks
(since the Postage Stamp scandal), he was shy
and new to office and the Permanent Under-secretary
was still the master of the show.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott’s own paper, <cite>The Keelson</cite>, was
not perhaps of very great influence in the
City; but it was the oldest in the shipping-trade,
and, though it certainly lost money, and
could obtain but very few advertisements, it was
read in every principal office in the provinces,
and could only be boycotted at a very considerable
expense in the London Press. Oddly
enough, it had acquired an established reputation
(for its opinions at least) in America
and the Colonies, though its total circulation
amounted to little more than two thousand
copies. To you and me, and Cosmo, and
Mr Barnett, and anyone who sees the world
from the inside, the thing was a rag, the losing
fad of a man more faddist than anyone in our
faddist time. But when you are dealing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
an investing public of millions, such fads must
be reckoned with: for they tell—men cannot
all print but they can all talk, and the wild rags
tell.</p>

<p>Abbott at lunch, two months before, had
sworn “by this and by that” to go into the
House of Commons. I will not repeat the
coarseness of his phrase. The man was so
happy-go-lucky, that his determination might
mean nothing at all; but Mr Barnett knew, as
well as anyone, that if Abbott should so choose
there were perhaps five constituencies in which
room would at once be made for him.</p>

<p>Lastly there was the fact of Abbott’s resistance.
Such resistance of itself demanded
caution.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that, one morning, without
so much as a note to announce him, Cosmo
walked straight into that little office, where
his father had suffered the chief pang of his life
two months before.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was eleven o’clock of an August morning,
and London was as hot as Rome. The energy
had gone out of things; the streets were
curiously silent; many of the offices deserted.
Mr Abbott sat sweltering in a shirt and white
breeches, which he had preserved from some
Eastern travel. He thought it his business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
to be there, and there he was; but no work
could he or any other man do on such a day.</p>

<p>Cosmo, rigidly dressed, and with an extreme
neatness, cool in the tropical weather, everything
about him ordered, came in with a brief
recognition. In the few months of his training,
he had advanced years in the knowledge
of conduct and of business, and was already
manifesting the material of which the great
successes are made. To almost any other
man in London, he would have used the
delicate art which a great scheme demands;
but he knew his man too well to attempt any
such art with Mr Abbott. Here and there,
you will discover, even in the modern world,
the man that must be driven. You will not
always succeed in driving him; but there
is only one method of approaching the business.
There was exact determination and
aim in every gesture of the young man: his
vigour and directness were the more remarkable,
in that until this moment he had never
used such an attitude—save possibly to
servants.</p>

<p>He sat down in a chair just opposite his
father’s friend. He put down his hat upon the
table with a slight, hard rap; looked Mr Abbott
steadily and strongly in the eyes (an effort so
unusual as to cause him positive pain), and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“I think you know why I have come.”</p>

<p>To such gross simplicity as the shipmaster’s,
all this was as yet nothing but an annoyance.
He took the young man’s hat off the
table, reached out so as to hang it on the gas
bracket behind him (whence it fell to the floor)
and said “No.” And, as he said it, a very
unpleasing expression passed across his face.</p>

<p>Cosmo jumped up, picked his hat off the
floor, brushed it with his arm, rapped it down
upon the table again and said, with admirable
self-restraint: “You know as well as I do why
I have come.”</p>

<p>“Let me put it up safely for you,” said Mr
Abbott, and he reached forward again for the
hat. Cosmo withdrew it and held it in his
right hand, and, even at that most incongruous
moment, Mr Abbott could not refrain from
laughter.</p>

<p>“You will have it,” he said; and his amusement
so far got the better of his temper, that
Cosmo thought for one moment inwardly
whether it would not be better to approach this
coarse mind by another channel. But his training
wisely persuaded him that the most direct
of methods was the best. The method whereby
men tame beasts; the masterly method of fear.</p>

<p>“I have come,” he said, still keeping himself
well in hand, “because matters cannot go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
much longer as they are doing now.” He
paused a moment to let the impression form.
“It can’t go on, Mr Abbott, and I have come
to tell you so quite frankly.... Before I
leave this room I mean the business to be
settled.... It can’t go on.”</p>

<p>Mr Abbott rang a bell.</p>

<p>A young and rather nervous clerk came in,
and gazed anxiously from one to the other, for
Cosmo’s face was unfamiliar to him, and there
had been quarrels of late.</p>

<p>“Arthur,” said Mr Abbott, “is it Friday or
Monday that the <em>Patagonia</em> sails?”</p>

<p>Cosmo looked up with something like a scare
on his face; he knew from his reading how
often these irrelevant questions may be leading
up to some great move.</p>

<p>“Monday, sir,” said Arthur in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Then you can just have the box of cigars
sent here,” said Mr Abbott jovially; “I’ll give
’em to Cap’n Gunn meself. I’d prefer to do
that. Rather than he shouldn’t have had ’em
o’ course I’d have sent ’em aboard. I thought
someowrother she sailed to-morrow. As ’tis,
why I’ll give ’em to him myself. That’s all
right, Arthur.”</p>

<p>Mr Abbott nodded and Arthur disappeared,
relieved.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Cosmo,” said Mr Abbott, leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
familiarly across the table like a second-rate
uncle, and wiping an enormous red handkerchief
over his face; I’m sorry; these things
aren’t of much importance, but if one don’t
attend to ’em at a time, you know....”</p>

<p>I have had to praise Cosmo for many things
in these pages, as I have had to blame him for
a few; for nothing was he more worthy of
praise than for his complete command of himself
at this moment. The effort of the severe
strain was hardly perceptible; certainly not to
so brutish a nature as his opponent’s.</p>

<p>“You were just saying, lad,” said Mr
Abbott, with increasing coarseness and kindliness,
“how the thing couldn’t go on. Well,
I’m sorry for it. But you can sell out, ye
know, and so can your poor old dad. Hasn’t
come to see me for weeks and weeks!” Mr
Abbott shook his head. “You can sell out,
you know. Of course, I dunno’ how it’ll look,
mind ye, but you can run the risk that there
won’t be any trial; safe risk to run now-a-days.”</p>

<p>Cosmo answered him in the clear measured
voice of a man whose plan is exactly defined,
and who is dealing with forces as irresponsible
as those of nature.</p>

<p>“Mr Abbott,” he said, “it is twenty-five
minutes past eleven; if I do not know before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
half-past that you are coming in, I shall go,
and our plans will be made accordingly.”</p>

<p>“And then the band played,” answered Mr
Abbott with exquisite vulgarity.</p>

<p>It was his theory (a theory which had so far
controlled him in this exchange of views) that a
man should never lose his temper. He gave
way to passion as little as possible. Three
times a week, perhaps, or five at the utmost.
Upon this occasion he struggled with himself;
in less than a moment came what is inevitable
with men of Mr Abbott’s hopeless type; he
exploded.</p>

<p>“And then the band played,” he repeated
somewhat inconsequently, “and then the—!
—! —! band played!” With each repetition,
his face got redder and redder, and his voice
rose: not very loudly, but soughing as do the
boughs of trees at the beginning of a storm.</p>

<p>“And then by —! the —! —! —! —! band
played!!” (every adjective was varied). “Oh
Lord” (striking the desk), “if you weren’t his
son! And if I hadn’t—well known you ever
since you were a little whining prig of a boy,
I’d throw you out of this little window; I
would! Out of this little — side window.
This dirty little,—little—, —, side window.
As it is, I’ll do nothing more than throw you
down the stairs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“AND THEN THE BAND PLAYED”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Towards the end of this extraordinary
harangue, Mr Abbott’s voice—huge in volume,
rolling in tone, thunderously deep in note and
menacing every species of violence in its mere
sound—was shaking the walls of the old room;
in the new, palatial offices without, clerks
were cowering; though they were not unused
to the echoes of such scenes.</p>

<p>Cosmo was standing up, he was very pale,
and his voice was only just master of itself;
but he did not give way. He stepped backward
and felt, without looking round, for the
handle of the door, as Mr Abbott rose gigantic
from beyond the table. And Cosmo said, very
rapidly, as a light gun retreating fires one last,
sharp, angry shell:</p>

<p>“Then we will freeze you out.”</p>

<p>With the last syllable of that final phrase
he slammed the door, and rippled down the
stairs into the street.</p>

<p>About three seconds after he had turned the
nearest corner, there was a roaring and a
storm on the landing he had passed; there
was terror in all the floors above, great boots
upon the stairs, and Mr Abbott, still in his
shirt-sleeves, was at the private door, glaring up
and down the street, half apoplectic in the heat,
and fearful to the passers-by. He turned,
still holding all his rage, clanked up the stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
again, burst through the door of his little room
and on into the splendid outer offices, all marble
and mahogany, where his clerks were shivering
like the doves in Virgil. He stood tremendous
in the entry and roared at them all: “You
heard that?—Freeze me out! Eh? You
heard it all of you? You heard it, I say?”
The wretched head clerk answered “Yes,”
which was a lie. Mr Abbott’s voice sank a
little, but only a little, as the sea sinks when
the tide turns in a gale. “Ah! You heard
it all. That’s better!” Then he went on
again: “Freeze me out! Freeze out Charles
Abbott of the Abbott Line! I’ll wring all
their necks!”</p>

<p>With that last pitiful, unpracticable, boasting
threat, this mass of noise, this anachronism
without strength or value, stooped to pass the
low door, regained his sacred den, assumed his
ancient wooden throne and sat there fuming
for an hour.</p>

<p>Long after, at dinner that evening, he found
himself muttering once or twice: “Freeze me
out!” and he felt blood coming up into his
face. But in the Plantagenet Club, westward
four miles, wiser and stronger men were deciding
what had best be done for the M’Korio,
for their England, and indeed for Mr Abbott
himself.</p>

<p>Far off in Norwood, Mr Burden slept.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">It was not altogether well with Mr Burden.
Strong Englishmen, even in age, will not
suffer in body (I think) through any mere
disquiet of the mind. The thing was a coincidence,
by which his silly doubtings mingled
with some more serious physical ailment. But,
whatever the cause, in those hot days immediately
succeeding Cosmo’s secret visit to
Abbott’s office, it was not altogether well with
Mr Burden.</p>

<p>At first a chill, or perhaps a passing weakness,
confined him to the house. Next he lost
appetite, and betrayed an irritability quite unusual
to him. His friends were heartily concerned.
The Honourable the Rev. Peregrine
Mauclerc called twice upon him, and left upon
the last occasion a marked copy of the <cite>Spectator</cite>,
containing a most interesting letter from the
Rector’s pen upon the subject of Hell, or
Annihilation.</p>

<p>Not quite a week later, Mr Burden leant
back at the table almost fainting, and it was
evident that he could not go into the City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>It was a collapse, nothing more. It was believed
that the necessary repose and a few days’
nursing in the house would restore my poor old
friend to health. Indeed, he was so restored,
and might still be with us but for the accidents
which I have yet to relate.</p>

<p>Though there was nothing definitely the
matter, Mr Burden’s wealth, and the value of
his well-being to so many others besides himself,
were sufficient to attract the aid of the
medical profession.</p>

<p>Cosmo’s profound, if silent affection was enhanced
by the consideration that his father’s
position in the world, and ultimately his own,
could not but benefit by a proper observation
of rank and circumstance: for, with every hour
he spent in the society to which his exceptional
brain had given him entry, Cosmo learnt more
and more the just weight of externals. Doctor
Cayley was sent for, and Doctor, or (as he
preferred to be called) “Mr” Gamble, the
specialist. It was the practice of both these
gentlemen to keep by them certain printed
forms, and the moment they were called to the
bedside of any distinguished patient, to fill in
the blanks and post them to all the leading
journals quite impartially, without distinction
of party. Cosmo himself, with quiet dignity,
gave notice of his father’s illness, and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
names of his medical attendants, to the <cite>Morning
Post</cite>, the <cite>Times</cite>, the <cite>Standard</cite>, the <cite>St James’s
Gazette</cite>, the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, the <cite>Eagle</cite>, the
<cite>Orb</cite>, the <cite>Mercury</cite>, the <cite>Star</cite>, the <cite>Daily News</cite>,
the <cite>Chronicle</cite>, the <cite>Intelligencer</cite>, the <cite>Globe</cite>,
and several other papers whose great position
compels them to print a Social Column.</p>

<p>Nor was Mr Barnett idle. The legend of
his influence upon the Press I have already
dispelled; but a man of such weight in our
commonwealth could not be heard without respect,
and a few messages from him created a
profound impression upon the many editors
who had tasted his hospitality.</p>

<p>Apart from all this it chanced that all the
proprietors, and most of the wealthier readers
of the principal organs of opinion were interested
in the M’Korio Delta; thus, from one
source and another, by a gradual accumulation
of impressions, each perhaps insignificant, Mr
Burden’s illness became the theme of very
serious public comment. Short leaders appeared;
there were pathetic kindly notes; a
fine letter from “Cantab” in the <cite>Telegraph</cite>,
and in the <cite>Spectator</cite> a touching poem—a lovely
little thing whose literary merit lent it but a
part, and that not the most considerable, of its
distinction and depth of feeling.</p>

<p>Nor was Mr Burden’s name printed alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
With every sympathetic reference to his condition,
some gracious word would be added in
recognition of his intimacy with Mr Barnett,
or of what England owed him for having given
her such a son as Cosmo. In papers of the
wider circulation an allusion to the M’Korio
Delta, which was now daily mentioned in at
least two places of each issue, gave zest and
meaning to the well-meant and charitable wishes
expressed for Mr Burden’s recovery.</p>

<p>Within five hours the two medical men
arrived at Norwood, and found there, already
at the door, Sir N. Lewison, whose European
reputation, ever at the service of Mr Barnett,
was never better employed than now. Indeed,
Mr Barnett had lent the great surgeon the
cream and blue Pompadour car wherein to
make the visit.</p>

<p>The three learned gentlemen proceeded to
the bedroom, where they found Mr Burden
sunk in a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>Gently waked by the soft gesture of the
nurse who was in attendance, his condition,
especially as regarded his heart, lungs and
liver, was examined with all the marvellous
skill that modern science has achieved; and
when the principal features of his case had
been accurately ascertained, the doctors retired
into a neighbouring dressing-room to hold a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
short consultation which should decide the
treatment of their patient.</p>

<p>In the opinion of Sir Nathan (who spoke
first), the arthritis was cardiac, or, at the very
least, arterial. He cited Pilkington’s note upon
Levasseur’s case, and quoted several exceptional
things of the sort which had come within
his own experience; notably his attendance
upon the Hereditary Grand Duke of Lowenburg.
With this conclusion, Dr Cayley found
himself wholly unable to agree; and, being a
man of humble origin,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who had risen by personal
merit alone, he expressed his difference
of opinion in the strongest language. He
saw in the whole matter a very simple case of
lesion in the biliary ducts, a view wherein he
was supported by Dr, or rather Mr Gamble,
the great specialist; the latter was, however,
unable to avoid a reference to his favourite
topic of the greater lymphatics.</p>

<p>The baronet (for Sir N. Lewison had been
raised from the knighthood on the occasion of
his services to the child of the Duke of Essex)
was too much of a man of the world to meet
violence with violence, and, after all, possessed
a science deep enough to discover that the
differences between them were of no ultimate
effect upon the patient’s treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>When an agreement had thus been reached,
they all three re-entered the room. Cosmo
joined them, and Dr Cayley, as the doyen of
the faculty, took it upon himself to reassure
Mr Burden. In an inaudible tone, such as the
presence of an invalid demands, he gave instructions
to the nurse that the patient should
be kept quiet, and should not be allowed to rise
until he felt completely rested. For diet they
prescribed the viands and beverages which Mr
Burden was in the habit of consuming, and so
passed downstairs into the hall, still discussing
the interesting technical aspects of his disorder,
balancing, as they did so, their eyeglasses between
the fore and middle fingers of their right
hands—a gesture, most unconscious and natural
in Dr Cayley and Mr Gamble, and so well
caught by Sir Nathan as hardly to betray the
effort of imitation.</p>

<p>The envelopes presented to them by a
servant contained the customary fees; and,
after many warm hopes for the swift recovery
of his father, they took leave of Cosmo, and
left the house to convalescence.</p>

</figure>

<p>I have dwelt at this length upon the medical
direction given by men of such eminence, not
only to show, as it is my duty to do, the filial
regard of Cosmo, but also to furnish an ample
explanation of his conduct at Avonmore during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>the illness; for, had not the confirmed opinion
of these high authorities assured him that his
father’s indisposition was but temporary, he
would never have pursued the course which
some severe critics have blamed, but which I
can only praise. As it was, he felt himself
justified in calling a certain number of chosen
guests daily under his roof, and in undertaking,
to some extent, the management of his father’s
affairs; he was confident, moreover, that Mr
Burden, on his approaching recovery, would
absolve him of all indiscretion, and commend
him even for his most speculative decisions.</p>

<p>It was announced with pardonable exaggeration
(but only in the daily papers whose pages
we hardly recall in our hurried modern life) that
Mr Burden, though still in feeble health, was
able to direct his affairs from the sick room;
and Cosmo did not hesitate, with a commercial
courage which the future justified, to use his
father’s name in several important expressions of
opinion. He wrote also to the Press, above his
own signature, twice within the space of a week,
strongly supporting an attitude of the Directors
which had been unduly criticised, and emphasising,
with a fine indignation, the treachery of the
unpatriotic crew who used his father’s name at
a moment when the great merchant was unable
to attend the meetings of the Board. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
it may truly be said that, at this moment when
Mr Burden’s body was most removed from the
affairs of the M’Korio, his spirit was omnipresent
in a way it had never been until that
moment; his credit and position, which were
of such incalculable advantage to that Imperial
venture, were never so strongly before the public
as at the moment when Cosmo, for his own wise
ends, was speaking in the old man’s name.</p>

<p>The splendid hospitality which the house at
Norwood displayed at this moment was of importance
equally critical. Not that the parties
were large, but that this distant villa, which
hitherto had seen few visitors, and those of but
a humdrum sort, now received men upon whose
capital or judgment, the principal affairs of our
time are conducted. In a few days the public
rumours of Mr Burden’s dissensions utterly died
away, and the old man’s solid career became in
the general estimation the pivot of the whole
M’Korian scheme. So true is it that Providence
does with us more than we mean! For Mr
Burden, passing the days upstairs between
sleeping and waking, glad that his son should
be seeing something of companionship during
this difficult period of his illness, would never
have had the tenacity or the judgment to
use his own influence as well as it was used by
Cosmo for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>The strong constitution which Mr Burden
had inherited, and which he had carefully preserved,
stood him in good stead during the
course of his little illness. Ten days after he
had taken to his bed, that is, upon August 23rd,
he felt himself again; he could eat heartily, he
read with a clear judgment, and he might, had
he not wisely deferred to the opinion of the
faculty, have left the house and gone about
his business.</p>

<p>His doctors, however, with the double object
of permanently curing their patient and of
advancing the science they adorned, determined
to defer his return to business.</p>

<p>With his physique, and under these conditions
of increasing strength, the analysis of
his malady became more and more difficult.
His medical advisers determined therefore to
prescribe a potion, whose virtue it was so to
lower the action of the heart and to befog the
brain, as to bring its recipient to a state the
pathology of which is common knowledge
throughout the profession. Thus artificially
reduced to a condition which would indeed be
morbid, but the familiarity of which would
permit them to agree upon its nature, they
could proceed from the known to the unknown,
they could build up a definite basis, they could
cure thoroughly, and they, the great scientists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
hoped, at the same time, to observe what organ
it was that had failed their patient, and had yet
eluded their consummate powers of observation.</p>

<p>A drug was therefore administered to him
by the nurse, and he was told, as invalids must
ever be, that it was but a harmless tonic. She
advised him, if he felt inclined for sleep in the
afternoon, to take a full rest: and, having thus
carried out her instructions to the letter, the
excellent woman went out for a few hours’ well-earned
recreation, and left her sufferer to repose.</p>

<p>But when he had drunk his medicine, Mr
Burden felt an odd fancy for the sun. The
window of his great bedroom looked north, and
he could see the summer light upon the trees
beyond; for the doctors had left him at eleven,
and it was noon. He ordered a servant, therefore,
to take his deck-chair down into the conservatory,
upon the southern side of the house:
a greenhouse opening out of the drawing-room,
of which indeed it formed a part, being
separated from it only by a curtained archway
supported upon columns in the Corinthian
manner. Just round the corner of this arch,
lying with a book in his hand which he would
not read, and covered with a light rug, he felt
a drowsiness not wholly pleasing come upon
him, and fell into a curiously hard and uneasy
slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whatever rules the world, it is not we.</p>

<p>An hour later, Cosmo brought Mr Barnett
home to lunch, as had been his custom during
all these days. The meal was short: they
feared to speak at the dining-table lest they
should wake Mr Burden, whose bedroom was
immediately above. To avoid disturbing him,
they went into the drawing-room together, to
talk at ease upon the subject which most absorbed
them; and Mr Barnett, in whom something
of the artist lingered, watched with
pleasure the contrast of strong light striking
the darkened room like a shaft from the greenhouse
beyond.</p>

<p>They spoke frankly one to the other, as is
the fashion of honest men, when they believe
themselves alone, and near them, in his chair
beyond the archway, Mr Burden lay steeped
in an unnatural slumber. Of what they said
to each other I know nothing; but I have
heard minutely the description of the phantasmagoria
which passed through the brain of
Mr Burden as the physic took effect.</p>

<p>He seemed to be now here, now there, but
always in a place of very bright colours and
strong scents under a hot sun; and, though
the scene continued to change, it had always
one thing in common, an expanse of marsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
and reeds and stagnant, slimy, steaming water:
tropical, and deadly to mankind. And up and
down this horror there passed, with movements
that corresponded to clouds in his own brain,
great animals, now fantastic, as Wyverns, now
of nature as hippopotami and sloths, but
always having in their expression, when they
turned towards him, something of the terrible.</p>

<p>Gradually in this place there were voices;
one voice he recognised for that of his son,
the other he could not fix; he knew it and
then he did not know it; it pulsated between
extremes of recognition almost absolute, and
again of a complete bewilderment. At last he
thought that he could attach a name to this
second voice, a name that began, he thought,
with an N; but the mere attempt at thinking
so pressed upon and tortured him, that his
poor soul abandoned itself again to the mere
watching of the confused and painful delirium.
And one voice, which was that of his son, was
speaking perpetually of fools, and of old
fashions, and saying that he knew them, as
though he were proud of knowing them; and
the other voice kept on insisting that something
or other must be done, and boasting of
strength and of power. Then the first voice,
Cosmo’s again, passed into another phase, and
entreated and cajoled; and the second voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
seemed only to sneer, and, in some astonishing
incongruous way, the name of his friend, the
name of the friend he had lost, the name of Mr
Abbott, came once and again upon the sufferings
of this poor old man, and mixed grotesquely
with those other vague and awful things. And
he heard a repeated reference to an approaching
death, and, on the other side, a repeated
sneer that death kept no certain hour.</p>

<p>Through all this tortured hour of vision the
body and the soul of him were not only in an
agony, but in an anarchy as well; for the
intellect was broken and did not reign. He
was entranced, and could not judge, but only
hear and see things quite inconsequent.</p>

<p>Then came the twilight whereby the soul of
a man escapes from darkness. It came rapidly.
First he could smell distinctly, it was the smell
of an excellent cigar; then, with his eyes half
closed, he saw a daylight which he knew was
not the cheating glare of his unnatural sleep,
and, with every moment, he caught the outer
senses more and more.</p>

<p>Mr Burden’s head was fuddled: he might
have been asleep and dreaming painfully, or
he might have heard spoken words: false or
true, he could not comprehend them thoroughly.
Even in health he would not have followed all
their meaning. Now they left upon him but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
a confused impression of inward desolation
and misery, which interwove with his physical
exhaustion and with the dull ache and ill-ease
of his body.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and saw the realities of
our world. He recognised in a row of pots
before him the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primula Robinsoniensis</i>, and
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ranuncula Japonica</i>, his gardener’s pride.
Still motionless, but more and more alive, he
noted the long lines of soot and grime upon
the glass, the bubbles of dried paint upon the
woodwork, and, on a corner of the iron frame
of the conservatory, the stamp of the makers,
“Aurora Works,” and the situation of their
industry, the Isle of Dogs. He stared at the
empty stove, and knew himself and his name.</p>

<p>He was broad awake. There were truly
voices in the next room; they were those of
Mr Barnett and of his son. So much was
real, but the marsh and the monsters had
vanished....</p>

<p>Cosmo’s voice, rapid and low, he could not
easily follow, but he caught the words “You
can’t.... How can you possibly? ... must
manage my father.”</p>

<p>Then a protesting series of earnest appeals
and an exhortation: “Not that way ...
not that way.”</p>

<p>His son’s voice and manner were so familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
to him, that Mr Burden almost saw the shake
of the head as he listened. But he could understand
nothing. Then again came Mr Barnett’s
voice, very deep and regular and slow.</p>

<p>“All that I cannot onderstand....” It
thus interrupted Cosmo twice, and came at
last impatiently and steadily. “So it most be
settled! So!” And he heard a heavy hand
come down by weight, and without violence,
upon the arm of a chair.</p>

<p>It occurred to Mr Burden suddenly that,
though he was listening to gibberish, yet he
was listening unseen. To a character of his
simplicity, the thought was odious. I do not
say it to ridicule him. In a way it does him
honour that he did not wish to be an eavesdropper;
and his desire to reveal himself was
the more laudable and just from the fact that
he could make no use, and indeed no sense, of
what he overheard.</p>

<p>He shifted awkwardly and wearily from his
invalid’s chair, stood up, somewhat dizzy for
the moment, and coughed as men do purposely
on the stage; he was not heard. Mr Barnett
had just repeated with emphasis the phrase:
“This fellow Âppott,” when, with that reminiscence
of his trouble full in his ears,
Mr Burden stood in the open archway which
led from the conservatory to the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>He held to a curtain, as though for support.
Mr Barnett stared at him, and Cosmo seeing
such a look in his companion’s eyes, swung
round sharply and, in his turn, saw his father.
He leapt at once to his feet and caught the old
man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” he cried. Then
he remembered his duty, and said, more gently,
“Where’s the nurse?”</p>

<p>Twenty surmises ran through his head. He
thought perhaps the old man was wandering—and
he thought of many other things. And,
during this very awkward pause, Mr Barnett,
whose great energies could ill brook interruption,
stared at the father and the son in the
doorway: the lower part of his strong face was
thrust forward, his eyes vivid with protest.
But he did not say a word, and Cosmo was
glad he did not.</p>

<p>Then Cosmo himself added, this time quite
gently:</p>

<p>“You might kill yourself! You were not
allowed to move after your medicine....
You must let me do everything.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">THE UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE OF MR BURDEN</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old man did not resist at all; he was led
across the room by Cosmo, past Mr Barnett,
at whom he feebly smiled, and from whom he
received no smile in return but still that powerful
indignant glance, and as he stumbled by:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>
<p>“I was asleep,” he murmured. For the only
time in his life he was not believed.</p>

<p>Cosmo led him upstairs again to his room.
His father slept again, but Cosmo waited till
the nurse returned. He took her aside and
spoke to her in such a fashion that she determined
to leave that roof—a decision she wisely
postponed. Then he went down, bracing himself
as best he could to find Mr Barnett.</p>

<p>To his very considerable annoyance, Mr
Barnett had gone. He ran down to the gate
and looked up Alexandrovna Road; but, if the
distant Panhard he saw was that of the financier,
it had gone too far for recall. He went back to
the house, up the drive, moodily; he stood
gazing for some minutes at the chair in the
conservatory, he paced and calculated the
distance between it and the place where he
and Mr Barnett had sat; then he went and
stood by the window and looked out for a long
time in silence, wondering at, and misreading,
everything.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With that unpleasant little episode, a mischance
which only the imperfect sympathies of
the various parties to it had exaggerated, Mr
Burden appeared to recover in a final manner.</p>

<p>His rapid restoration was due, in part, to the
physicians, who found his symptoms far easier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
to analyse under the effects of the drug than
they had been during the complex reactions of
his convalescence; and in part to the curious
obstinacy of the old man himself who, with a
vivid memory of their last experiment, successfully
refused to touch another spoonful of
medicine. Under the combined influence of
their science and his mother-wit, he was
within three days dressed and about the house.
Within a week he was walking out daily, and
soon manifested that revolt against restraint,
which is but the return of an active and working
brain to its normal functions.</p>

<p>As Mr Burden could spend more and more
of the day downstairs, Cosmo rightly thought
it less and less his duty to waste his time at
home. Such was his zeal in his new-found
opportunities for work, that he would leave
the house before his father had been permitted
to rise; and the recreation necessary after a
long day, not to speak of private calls which
had to be made upon other members of the
original syndicate, commonly prevented his
return until long after his father was asleep.</p>

<p>In these days, therefore, which just preceded
Mr Burden’s reappearance in the City, he saw
but little of his son.</p>

<p>Of Mr Barnett he saw and heard even less,
on account of that deplorable imbroglio with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
which my reader is already acquainted. The
interval was short. It was but a fortnight
after the scene in the drawing-room, that the
doctor gave Mr Burden leave to resume his
business activities; but the continued loneliness
and silence had borne upon him very
heavily.</p>

<p>I myself saw him in those days, and I myself
was deceived by his reaction towards health.
I did not comprehend, nor did anyone comprehend,
how deep was the wound which even so
short an illness and one of so indeterminate a
nature could inflict upon such a character as
Mr Burden’s, a character already shaken by
doubt and continual nameless perplexities.</p>

<p>We could all see that he had been thrust
suddenly beyond the boundary of old age,
but we could not see the further thing: I
mean, that he was very near to the last fall of
all; that any sudden blow might be his end.</p>

<p>That blow was delivered, of course, by the
blundering hand of the unpardonable Abbott.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It will readily be perceived that, with a man
of Mr Abbott’s temper, the great forces of
modern England would breed, not only a
reactionary hatred, but a mania for suspicion.</p>

<p>The man was for ever putting two and two
together. He was perpetually seeing conspiracies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
where no conspiracy existed, nay
where no conspiracy could, in the nature of
things, exist. He would smell out the secret
influences of what he called “cosmopolitan
finance,” in the actions of the dullest and most
orderly of civil servants. He had dropped one
newspaper after another, proceeding on a scale,
as it were, from the fairly sane to the hopelessly
fanatical. At last he had come to reading
none, with the exception of a weekly sheet
which not only floundered into every mare’s
nest of politics, but was largely supported by
subscriptions from Mr Abbott himself.</p>

<p>With such a temper attaching to the ordinary
affairs of the State; with a view of the occupation
of Egypt (for example) that it was provoked
by a group of bankers and scripholders;
with the confirmed opinion that the problems
of the Irish Land were principally due to the
greed of English moneylenders—with every
illusion a belated radical can nourish, it is not
wonderful that Mr Abbott, the moment difficulties
of any sort threatened himself, should
have positively raved.</p>

<p>A man of quieter temper would have known
that Cosmo’s strong and virile attitude during
the moment of their short interview was a
piece of very legitimate <em>finesse</em>. A man who
could see modern commerce as it is, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
have admired the young man for the attempt,
but would have known how little strength lay
behind it.</p>

<p>You cannot “freeze out” a man in Mr
Abbott’s position. A shipowner, a prosperous
member of the most prosperous trade in England,
has no paper floating about that you can
buy up; the investment of his savings are not
commonly in such securities as even a group
of enemies can largely affect. The principal
weapons of that engrossing warfare which is
the crusade and school of knighthood of our
day, are useless in shipping circles. Freights
are still a sort of neutral ground in the fierce
contest of high souls, and will so remain until
one dominating brain shall have pooled the
interests of the main lines, frozen out the
tramps, and unloaded the shares of a Trust
upon legislators in such a manner as to forbid
the interference of Parliament.</p>

<p>In spite of the strength of his position, however,
Mr Abbott’s suspicions raged. A Government
contract which lay between him and the
Excelsior Line fell to the Excelsior. He
employed two men at Somerset House for five
days to discover the shareholders of the Excelsior,
and of the syndicate that was behind
the Excelsior, and of the investing company
which was the principal holder of the syndicate:—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
so forth. He got very little for
his pains; but he remained convinced that
some influence allied to the M’Korio had
defrauded him.</p>

<p>A cargo of which he had made certain at
Barcelona failed him, and the ship came home
in ballast. The innocent name of the worthy
Spaniard who had been unable to oblige was
darkly connected in his mind with Mr Harbury.</p>

<p>He had great difficulty in effecting an insurance
upon the <em>Polecat</em>. He was asked a rate
which he would not pay, and she went out
uninsured. More than three weeks overdue
in the customary run to the Plate, he did at
last reinsure at thirty-five guineas; the very
next day she appeared, apologetic but undamaged,
in the river. If Mr Abbott had
dared, he would have talked of bribery.</p>

<p>A succession of small incidents such as these,
incidents which in fifteen days had hardly cost
him £15,000, had driven Mr Abbot quite off
his balance; and it happened that, on the
evening before Mr Burden was to return to his
business, Mr Abbot sat down and wrote to
Norwood a letter as mad as ever man wrote;
but in such terms as have since, I am glad to
say, been found indictable before a common
jury.</p>

<p>I must offer a passing apology for printing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
it; it is the business of a recorder to record,
and I am impelled to put down even this
offensive extravagance.</p>

<p>The letter reached Avonmore by the first
post of Monday, the 3rd of September. It
came with a batch of others on that morning
when Mr Burden had determined to return to
town; the morning of a day upon which he
was expected to see, for a moment a least, his
fellow Directors at the offices of the M’Korio.</p>

<p>The merchant came down to breakfast
cheerily, with a deceptive thin veneer of health.
He sat at his table assuming the airs of old
(Cosmo had long been gone); he opened his
correspondence envelope by envelope. The
first, second, and third, were circulars; the
fourth was a wedding card, the fifth a prospectus;
he saw next Mr Abbott’s handwriting,
and his mind changed, darkened, and grew
cold, as does a plain in early summer when a
snow cloud comes above it from the hills. He
opened the envelope and read these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Burden</span>,</p>

<p>“I don’t mind your being hand and glove
with a greasy German Jew, nor your toadying
a jointed hop-pole like that bankrupt Benthorpe;
and as for Cosmo coming into my office
and threatening me, I only mind just so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
as to prevent him ever coming there again. But
what I will not have is that any of your dirty
gang should interfere with my business; and
if another ship of mine goes wrong in any way,
I warn you, and you can warn your Lords and
your Jews and your Cabinet Ministers, that I
will sink the cost of another ship in smashing
the lot of you. I write to you because you are
the only one I know, and you may take it from
me that I shall not write again.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such was the letter.</p>

<p>There are many things in this mad scrawl
which I should digress a moment to ridicule
and condemn, were it not more germane to the
spirit of my record to pass them by in contemptuous
silence. But there is one phrase which
I cannot treat with the neglect it deserves. I
mean the phrase about Lord Benthorpe.</p>

<p>The abominable meanness in a man of Mr
Abbott’s wealth harping on the poverty of a
superior is not my theme: it is enough to say
that, had the cases been reversed, Lord Benthorpe
would never have descended to expose
the misfortunes of Mr Abbott. I have rather
to comment upon the word “bankrupt.”</p>

<p>By the time the matter comes into court, it
is probable (considering the dilatory habits of
Mr and Mrs O’Rourke) that my work will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
regarded as the standard account of Mr
Burden’s life. I am in possession of this precious
epistle. It is before my eyes as I write,
and I desire to put it publicly, with all my
special knowledge of the circumstances, at the
service of the perfect gentleman whom he has
wronged.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott will find, I think, that our English
law of libel is strong enough and flexible enough
to punish most heavily the use of such a term.
His lordship never has passed, nor, please
God! ever shall pass, through the Bankruptcy
Court. Of his unfortunate lack of means I
have already spoken—I trust as delicately as
possible—nor have I concealed from my readers
the ready help and sympathy he received from
his friends in the financial world. But between
honourable poverty and defalcation, both English
law and English sense draw a sharp line,
as the slanderer will discover to his cost.</p>

<p>I will dwell no more upon the point. It is
not the fashion of the Island Race to pre-judge
a matter which is so soon to fall beneath a
judge: Mr Justice Hopper, for many years a
strong supporter in Parliament of the Water
Companies and the National Party.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Mr Burden had read Abbott’s shameful
words, though he had not yet gathered all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
that they implied, and was rather stunned than
wounded by them in the first moment, a look
of age passed over his face: that look which
was to return once or twice in the next few
hours, and each time to mean that on his soul
was blowing a sharp gust of death.</p>

<p>He laid his left hand heavily upon the table,
sighed, and picked up his remaining letters and
opened them. One was a receipted bill from
his wine merchant; the next a letter from his
daughter, Mrs Legros, asking for money: the
parish was a poor one, and they had to feed
the lambs.... Clarence, moreover, was suffering
from measles, and Billy needed a watch.
The next was a circular from a company which
desired to cover his floors, not with carpets,
but with a kind of cheap linoleum; he frowned
and threw it in the fire. The next was the
reminder letter of summons to the meeting of
the Board of Directors which was to be held
in Broad Street, that afternoon, at four.
Methodically he put the hour down on a piece
of paper, folded it and slipped it into a waistcoat
pocket; but his hand trembled as he did
so, and the hour he put down was wrong.
The next letter was an appeal for funds from
a society for the Prevention of Evil, two more
were about American quack medicines, and the
last was an angry note from a local tradesman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
whose goods (so Mr Burden’s housekeeper
constantly maintained) had neither been ordered
nor received, and were therefore left unpaid for.</p>

<p>When he had read all this, his correspondence,
Mr Burden’s left hand stretched out
again, his eyes not following it, and unsteadily
took up Mr Abbott’s letter. He read it a
second time.</p>

<p>Its ridiculous language could touch no chord
of humour, for all those chords were silent; nor
of resentment, for the man was already broken.
Cold senile tears gathered in his eyes; he put
the letter down again, and gazed across his
lonely table at the window and the grey
London sky without. Then, at last, he rose
with a determination in his heart.</p>

<p>As he went through the hall and groped a
little too long for his hat, his housekeeper, a
woman who had been with him since his wife’s
last illness, bade him not go out, telling him
he was not fit to try even the summer air, still
less attuned to business; but, by his expression
and manner, it was evident that none of these
things mattered to him at all.</p>

<p>He was opening the door with the intention
of walking directly to the station, when the
bell rang, and he saw, upon the step without, a
man whom he had known for many years: a
Mr Hale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>Mr Hale greeted him with respect, and Mr
Burden, after looking at him some time before
speaking, as is the way with men who suffer
either in body or in mind, took him by the
arm almost familiarly, and said:</p>

<p>“Come with me, Mr Hale, and say whatever
you have to say as I go down to the station.”</p>

<p>Mr Hale was overwhelmed by so much condescension—for
Mr Hale was of no position in
the world.</p>

<p>This citizen was an excellent example, not
only of what human industry may do against
harsh conditions, but also of the squalls of evil
fortune which overtake merit even in its hours
of success.</p>

<p>His father had been a rag-and-bottle merchant
and dealer in kitchen-stuff during the
’fifties, and had plied his trade in a very little
shop so near to Mr Burden’s house as to be a
capital <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débouché</i> for the perquisites of the cook.
He left sufficient capital at his death for his
son to set up as an undertaker: a public servant
the necessity of whose presence was then increasingly
felt in the growing and prosperous
suburb.</p>

<p>In this trade Mr Hale, junior, did very well
for some time. He enlarged his premises,
and put in his window the striking sign of a
coffin accompanied by the words, “Simplicity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
Despatch, Economy and Reform,” the last of
which abstractions had, until recent years,
seemed peculiarly congenial to the political
spirit of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Mr Burden had first come to know him in
connection with the death of a young man, a
neighbour, of whom he had been in a sort of
way the guardian; he had later entrusted him
with the mortal remains of Mrs Burden.</p>

<p>But, shortly after that memorable date, misfortune
overtook the hitherto prosperous purveyor.
The increased facility of communication
caused many of his clients to turn for
the last rites to larger firms in the centre of
London, and even to entrust their lifeless clay
to the limited companies which had begun to
compete with the smaller capitalists of the
profession. The practice of cremation also,
increasing somewhat in favour with the middle
classes, had cut into his profits; and two years
of exceptional local health, during which his
permanent expenses could not be reduced, had
eaten up his little reserve. More than once
he had undertaken a few jobs of cabinet work
for Mr Burden, who was ever ready to help
those around him; but this kind of job had to
be done under the rose, as being beneath the
dignity, and, indeed, opposed to the rules, of
the Society to which Mr Hale belonged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>In the last few weeks things had become
desperate with him; and, to tell the truth, he
was approaching Mr Burden upon this occasion
for the loan of £10.</p>

<p>I have no space to detail the conversation
which passed between the two, and I can only
plead my old friend’s great weakness, the recent
destruction of his whole stamina and nerve,
as an excuse for his acceding to Mr Hale’s
request. It was against all his principles, as
it must be against those of every sober reader
of these lines, to lend money.</p>

<p>He lent it because he was in that mood
of mixed softness, abandonment, and sadness,
which so often precedes a catastrophe.</p>

<p>They parted outside the station, Mr Hale
with overwhelming thanks and repeated promises
of repayment, Mr Burden gazing at him
as though at some memory of the past, then
saying:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr Hale,” and he said it with
as much affection and solemnity as though he
were bidding farewell for ever to one of his
oldest friends.</p>

<p>Mr Hale smiled in a terrified manner and
departed; Mr Burden went down the stairs,
took his train, and sat silent all the way into
town. For the first time in I know not how
many years he held no newspaper in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>When he came to the City he went directly
to Leadenhall Street, and, purposely passing
the little familiar archway which led to his
friend’s private room, went in at last by the
great public entrance of Mr Abbott’s offices.</p>

<p>But as the big plate-doors swung to, he felt
something mortal upon him.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Mr Burden stood at the counter where
little rails of shining brass were reflected
in the polished wood. He looked for some
immediate obedience; but his aspect at this
moment was not such that his wealth or station
could be seen.</p>

<p>Mr Burden stood at the counter with both
his hands upon it, waiting till someone should
notice that he was there. Such duties are
reluctantly undertaken by the youngest of a
company, and there approached him at length a
young clerk with pale and curly hair, watery blue
eyes, and of a frank, uncivil manner, as though
his heart were in the right place but very small.</p>

<p>Mr Burden said to him:</p>

<p>“I want to see Mr Abbott.”</p>

<p>With easy negligence the young clerk
shoved across the counter a form on which
was printed:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 65%">
<img src="images/i_284.jpg" alt="form">
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>Mr Burden looked at this form a moment,
and then lifting his head:</p>

<p>“Give him my name,” he said.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> yer name.”</p>

<p>“Burden ... Mr Burden. Tell Mr
Abbott Mr Burden is here, and wishes
most particularly to see him.”</p>

<p>The young clerk sauntered off with a careless
ease, and Mr Burden stood waiting at the
counter. His face was very pale, his manner
unsteady. Beyond, in little pens of glass, ill-paid
men, working at books, peeped furtively;
some smiled, others looked round to catch a
neighbour’s eye. Mr Burden was oblivious of
it all.</p>

<p>The young clerk returned and said, as a
servant in livery speaks to a tradesman in none:</p>

<p>“Mr Abbott can’t see you.”</p>

<p>Patches of colour lit up in Mr Burden’s face;
but, before he spoke or moved, a little dry,
grey man who had served his master faithfully
for twenty years, and to whom Mr Burden was
as familiar as the City streets, had seen what
was passing and had come forward. He pushed
aside the very foolish youth, and said in a low,
respectful voice:</p>

<p>“You had much better wait a little, Mr
Burden, sir; you had indeed.”</p>

<p>Mr Burden shook his head slowly. He took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
up an office pen and wrote a few lines upon a
memorandum sheet. He folded it and put Mr
Abbott’s name outside.... “Take him that,”
he said, “I must see him.”</p>

<p>What he had written I do not know; but
I am assured that the address was almost
illegible, so violently did his hand tremble.</p>

<p>The little grey man went off in some fear.
He was not long away. When he came back,
he bore in his hand the same note, unopened.
“I am very sorry, Mr Burden, sir,” he said, most
anxiously ... “indeed, if you will let me....”</p>

<p>Mr Burden took the note from him and tore
it into twenty pieces methodically and strongly,
and scattered them upon the floor, casting
them deliberately down like seed to grow up
into some remorseful harvest. Then, the little
grey man watching him anxiously as he went,
he passed through the monumental doors into
the street.</p>

<p>It was with a most unnatural energy that he
pushed through the crowds on the pavement.
His emotion forced a spasm of life through the
worn channels of his brain; he walked rapidly,
his head bent down, till he came to Broad
Street and the offices of the M’Korio. The
giant saw him as he passed up the great stairs
and saluted him, but Mr Burden noticed
nothing. He went on at once to that principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
room, where he knew that a meeting of the
Board was to be held, and into this room
he strode, full of purpose, but checked a
moment by the presence of others as he
entered.</p>

<p>He saw by the window the little group which,
as he thought, had ruined his peace for ever,
and, among them, he saw Cosmo. He saw
Cosmo standing as a friend of theirs should
stand, talking with them familiarly.</p>

<p>They were four: Cosmo and Mr Barnett,
Lord Benthorpe and Mr Harbury: their minds
at ease on that quiet and sunlit afternoon, fresh
with the activity of the City, ready for the
action of life.</p>

<p>To each of them great fortune promised:
and to Mr Barnett, who was already very
wealthy, more than fortune—true political
power, a thing to him worth all the effort of a
life. They stood there at the window, these
four men, making not only their own success,
but the success of England, and building up
yet another new people over seas. There
was a natural buoyancy in all their attitudes;
the hard work had been done, and only the
last stone remained to be raised. Then the
one would have recovered his honour, another
have solved his indebtedness, another have
found himself secure for the first time in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
permanent wealth, another in retirement and
leisure, and strong over men.</p>

<p>They knew, indeed, what phantasies and
little meticulous rules had haunted this fifth
man that had entered. They knew their
Mr Burden by this time; especially Cosmo,
his son, foresaw what effort had still to be
gone through. But they had no doubt of
success, for a man thus sensitive is also weak
and very yielding to persuasion: nay, as he
entered, that weakness of his was apparent, in
the hesitation of his step and the uncertain
glance which he cast upon them.</p>

<p>Cosmo hung back a little, for he revered
his father. The three others came forward
with effusion; Lord Benthorpe with perhaps
rather more restraint than the rest; and
Mr Barnett, taking it upon himself to be
spokesman said:</p>

<p>“My dear Mr Burden!” and he took Mr
Burden’s hand in his right hand and put his
left hand over it and held it fast, to show a
real friendship; and then he pulled up to the
table a great chair of dignity, and asked
Mr Burden to be seated in it. Mr Burden
said: “Thank ye”: he sat down slowly, as
would a man that bore a heavy sack upon
his shoulders, and the rest sat down around
the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>After a little silence, Cosmo asked his father
whether his train had been punctual. Mr
Burden answered oddly. He said in a manner,
which (alas!) still savoured of pomposity:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen....” Then he coughed and
was silent.</p>

<p>Mr Barnett, who all his life had possessed
the art of managing men, smiled a ready, but
not convincing smile, and said:</p>

<p>“Eh, Mr Burten? Yes?”</p>

<p>Mr Burden, with a troubled look, and with
eyebrows drawn together and upwards, looked
round at them, avoiding the eyes of each, and
gazed to his right at the window, as might a
man who had the direction of a battle, but
who knew nothing of war, and who saw the
closing in of lines;—and fate, and dread, and
ending coming forward upon him out of the
smoke and clamour.</p>

<p>He turned his head slowly round; he shifted
his feet nervously, and he began again:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen ... I have been thinking ...
that there are some things ... I don’t say
many ... but still there are some things which
might be settled without hurting us and without
hurting anyone else, and.... Of course I
understand the position fully.” He tried to
smile and failed. “I am a man of the
world, gentlemen; I understand the position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
fully ... I know it may be a little sacrifice
... I think you will all agree with me it
should be settled.”</p>

<p>Mr Barnett, who all his life had possessed the
art of managing men, cleared his throat, and
spoke rapidly in a confident tone: his hands
were clasped before him upon the table, his
short creative thumbs were pressed together.
He said:</p>

<p>“I think we exactly know what it is in
Mr Burten’s mind? It does Mr Burten to his
honour. Mr Burten is alluding herein, Lord
Bent’orpe” (for Mr Barnett always addressed
Lord Benthorpe upon such occasions—and
Lord Benthorpe bowed very slightly, as men
do who owe nothing and can give much)
“Mr Burten is alluding, Lord Bent’orpe, I
say, to our policy with regard to Mr Âppott
herein. Mr Burten, it does you much to your
honour.”</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe, whose ignorance of all
these things was that of a sincere and honourable
gentleman, bowed again to Mr Burden:
it was a very slight bow, even more slight than
that accorded to Mr Barnett; and I am sorry
to say that, immediately afterwards, he had
the lack of tact to remark: “I am sure that
any such small matter as Mr Burden wishes
can be arranged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Mr Barnett betrayed considerable irritation.</p>

<p>“With all respect due,” he said—in spite
of his accent, he had a great command of
English idiom—“with all respect due, and
ready, Lord Bent’orpe, and with every desire
I have to spare——” here he hesitated a
moment, and Mr Harbury, to whom English
was a familiar language, murmured, “susceptibilities”—“susceptibilities,”
continued
Mr Barnett, still pondering on all the syllables,
“we have other interests herein than alone
our own to consider. We have the interests
also of the shareholders surely to consider. I
think one will agree with me? Ah?”</p>

<p>He lay back a little in his chair, and looked
round at his three companions, and then a
little rapidly to his left at Mr Burden: Mr
Burden was silent, and Mr Barnett went on:</p>

<p>“We have, I say also, the shareholder-interest
to consider. If we had ourselves
alone to safeguard so, we should be understanding
Mr Åppott’s position; indeed, I am
very sure. Büt” (and here Mr Barnett
lowered his voice in a manner which would
have been impressive even to a larger audience,
and wagged his head gloomily): “Büt have
we choice I fear...?”</p>

<p>He looked sadly a moment at the middle of
the table, with an expression not unlike that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
an animal about to be sacrificed, then throwing
up his hands with the palms outwards, said in a
sudden return of native feeling:</p>

<p>“Ach! God! He hass not come in! He
hass not come in! It is right on his own
head, I say.”</p>

<p>It was not often that Mr Barnett allowed a
sudden revulsion of feeling to awaken in him
the exclamations of his youth, but he felt
strongly upon Mr Abbott’s action; he thought
it stupid; he thought it unbusiness-like. He
thought it dangerous to the M’Korio Delta
Development Co. He thought it, from what
he knew of the English, un-English, and,
during the few seconds of that angry phrase, a
native phrase had returned to him, strongly
borne upon a gust of natural passion.</p>

<p>Cosmo tentatively intervened:</p>

<p>“Perhaps, father, you could go and see Mr
Abbott again?” Mr Burden, hearing the voice
of his son, and being thereby suddenly reminded
of his home and of many years, looked
up with an awful pain in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” he said.</p>

<p>Then there was another awkward silence,
which Lord Benthorpe did not much relieve
by saying twice the words, “I hope, ... I
hope,” and looking round with an uncertain
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Mr Harbury broke in, with the air of a man
whose thought has matured; he leant his chin
upon his left hand, and looked steadily at Mr
Burden.</p>

<p>“Mr Burden, I think you will admit that Mr
Abbott should have come in. If he does not
come in, we are absolutely bound to oppose
him with all our force. You see that as well
as I do. You cannot justly complain if we
destroy that which attempts to destroy us.
You cannot justly complain if you refuse to
persuade him further, and refuse also to help
us in our self-defence against him. There is
no possible third course.”</p>

<p>All this was said fixedly and clearly, as Mr
Harbury had long learnt to say the thing that
should dominate a weak man’s mind; but
Mr Burden was so ill as to be perverse and
irrational; and the anger that makes men
drunk was rising up in him again.</p>

<p>He cried much louder than he had meant:</p>

<p>“I have said all I have to say.”</p>

<p>His anger filled and impelled him; he kept
control of his body to some extent, but no
longer of his mind; and he continued still
loudly, without reason, and forgetting his
determination to be cold:</p>

<p>“I will not be a party to any intrigue
against my friend!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>Now such are the limits of human nature,
and such is its feebleness, that even men like
Mr Barnett (who had known all his life how
to manage men) can lose their steadfast poise
in a sharp moment of wrath. He looked round
smartly, he put his face somewhat too suddenly
forward, as towards an opponent, and thrust
into Mr Burden’s already kindled fires the fuel
of an insult.</p>

<p>Those two deep sunken lines which marked
the financier’s heavy cheeks like furrows and
drew down the lowering corners of his mouth,
were contracted into a kind of intense sneer;
and he said, without opening his teeth:</p>

<p>“You will party be to your pocket whatever!”</p>

<p>Then Mr Burden, power bubbling up within
him in spite of his age, in spite of his illness,
and filled, in spite of his wealth, with a desire
for freedom, cried out at him:</p>

<p>“Take care, Barnett, you’re going a little
too far, just a little too far.... I wouldn’t
have that ... not for worlds!”</p>

<p>Mr Burden’s breath came very quickly, and
he had his lips as closely pressed together as
any had yet seen them, and his head was full
with the blood of his anger. But there was
anger in Mr Barnett also, though of another
race and kind and climate; and he said with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
full sneer, where only half a sneer had been
before:</p>

<p>“What can you do? So?”</p>

<p>I repeat, for the twentieth time, that Mr
Barnett’s knowledge of men had never failed
him. He must not be judged on this exceptional
case, nor condemned because he underestimated
the follies that men like Mr Burden can commit,
when their state of mind is such as was then
Mr Burden’s state of mind. For, a passion
like a fighting passion possessed Mr Burden,
and rioted through his aged and enfeebled
body, forcing its organs beyond their power,
and straining the material framework of his
life. In that passion he had forgotten decent
conduct; he had forgotten investments and all
that investments should mean to a just and
reasonable man. He repeated without moving:</p>

<p>“What can I do?” He said it two or
three times in a low voice. He remembered a
furious letter to the Press which he had not
posted: he remembered his fear lest the Press
should refuse to print it. He remembered his
sufferings as the syndicate was preparing, he
remembered his yielding, and what that yielding
had cost him in the soul. He remembered
above all Mr Abbott, Charles Abbott, his friend—and,
remembering these things, he lost all
control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>He snatched up his hat from the ground,
and thrust it far back upon his head at random:
he sprang upright: he held his chair tilted back
with one hand; with the other he grasped his
umbrella in a kind of swagger, tip to ground,
as though it had been the scabbard of a sword.
He seemed vigorous, or perhaps distraught:
intoxicated with the words that rose in him.</p>

<p>Mr Harbury, whose judgment I will always
trust in such matters, and who was once not
unacquainted with the management of the
stage, has told me that never in his life, not
even in the Levant, had he seen so dramatic a
passage of anger as was that of this old
Englishman in the toils: all his respectable
English dress was at random; his sober English
gestures became those of a man who fights or
labours; and it is a detail worthy of notice,
that the bone stud at his throat broke as he
started up, and that his collar went flying loose
at random. He shouted at them:</p>

<p>“What can I do? Oh, I can do a great
deal, I can! You, Barnett, and you, Harbury,
and all of you! All!”</p>

<p>Perhaps he actually felt the presence of a
crowd: the massed forces of this new world
surging against him; he spoke as though to
numbers.</p>

<p>“I can smash it! I can smash you, and your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>precious shareholders ... and, and the Duke
... and the whole thing! I can go and say
why I went! Eh? Oh! good Lord! and I
shall print it.... If they won’t print it in
your cursed papers, I’ll placard it; I’ll cover
the town with it; I’ll put your names up high—all
your names—your names that you hide,
and the names that you have had and lost ...
swindlers and thieves and scum!”</p>

<p>And, after that outburst, he recovered himself
a moment, and stood away from them,
breathing too hard, while Mr Harbury looked
down, and Mr Barnett smiled a drawn smile
of hatred that would not betray fear.</p>

<p>Lord Benthorpe, a soldier in his youth, was
very genuinely afraid; he was afraid of something
indefinable, of catastrophe ... he did
not understand these things.</p>

<p>There passed through Mr Burden’s mind a
spasm of calm which he mistook for self-control;
he fumbled at his collar trying to straighten it,
he put on a civic dignity, and stood up stiffly,
and turned to his son and said:</p>

<p>“Come with me, Cosmo.”</p>

<p>Cosmo, whom this wild scene had distressed
beyond bearing, looked down nervously at the
table, shuffled the papers before him, and
murmured almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>“Don’t make a fool of yourself, father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>Then Mr Burden, stooping forward hurriedly,
went out.</p>

<p>There was a full three minutes of silence,
during which Mr Barnett’s face looked like the
face of one of those old and monstrous things,
enormous, dug from Assyrian sands, while Mr
Harbury coughed twice, and sidled his eyes
uncertainly, and Lord Benthorpe twiddled his
fingers upon his trembling knees.</p>

<p>Then Cosmo, still in confusion, desiring
to see whether indeed he would ruin them
all and desiring to be rid of the atmosphere
of anger, got up and went out after his father.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the street another beam of those few
which support the structure of human life
crashed within him; the old man’s brief draft
of energy ran out and was lost utterly.</p>

<p>The mechanical action continued; he could
pass through the crowds with whom he had
mixed for fifty years, but he felt a growing
tension of the brain and some such abandonment
of grasp and power, as men feel who are
drowning, and who lose their consciousness
just before they drown.</p>

<p>A few steps behind him followed Cosmo, his
son. Interests, more momentous than the life
of one man, made it imperative to Cosmo that
the M’Korio should not be betrayed. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
was just time for his father to give notice of disclaimer;
there was ample time to visit some
one of those newspapers that continued in spite
of loss and a deserved unpopularity to attack
our great scheme of Empire. The exchange
was shut. There was time to ruin everything
before the morning. Nor could Cosmo know
what his father suffered: he followed in the
interests of the M’Korio, and, happily, his father
did not know that he followed.</p>

<p>There are duties of many kinds; and Cosmo
was doing one of these many duties as best he
knew.</p>

<p>He saw his father pass the statue of Mr
Peabody, philanthropist, cross Cornhill, and
King William Street, and make for the Cannon
Street terminus; but Cosmo was a man to do
his duty, when he did it, thoroughly: it is a
habit to which he owes the great position he
now enjoys.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He did not lose sight of Mr
Burden until he had seen him actually enter
the gates of the railway station; then only did
he turn away, with heaven knows how much
relief, and plan such recreation as was legitimately
his after the strain of the last few hours.
He sent first a telegram to Mr Barnett to
reassure him, and then cast off all business and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
went west, to spend the evening with such
companions as he had previously engaged.</p>

<p>But Mr Burden, bowing under the increasing
weight of his malady, hesitated as he went
up to take his ticket. He had forgotten, and
was at a loss in everything. He did not remember
his season ticket; and, when he stood
before the little window, an impatient crowd
gathered behind him, cursing at his delay. He
had forgotten even the name of the station for
his home. The trained clerk was quick enough
to meet the difficulty. He took the gold piece
that the old merchant had put down, and gave
him in exchange such a third-class ticket as
would carry him to the very extremities of the
suburban zone. Mr Burden looked at the
unfamiliar name upon the paste-board and
moved slowly on to the platform; a considerable
volley from the long queue whom he had
just released followed his shambling figure; till
a wit at the head of it restored the public
humour by giving him very publicly the title
of Methuselah. Mr Burden, wandering vaguely
towards the train, did not so much as hear.</p>

<p>On the platform the porters knew him, and,
in spite of the colour of his ticket, opened for
him a first-class carriage; one, with the ready
courtesy of his kind, helped him to his place,
then, turning, tapped his forehead and jerked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
his thumb over his shoulder with a leer; for
Mr Burden was evidently very ill indeed.</p>

<p>In the train he sat, relieved by some repose,
and conscious (in a blurred way) that an old
man in the corner of a railway carriage was
safer from insult and observation, than wandering
on a platform, a thing for gibes.</p>

<p>He sat dully, his brows contracting now and
then. The names of the stations pleased him,
because they were familiar. He tried to remember
their order, or at least the name of
such as he had not yet reached; but he could
not. He was puzzled, and looked round at his
fellow passengers, as though for help. They
glanced at him above their papers, and saw that
he was ill. They feared for the decencies.
One, more refined than the rest, bolted out at
the next stopping-place. The others defended
themselves with silence, reading steady behind
the bulwark of the evening papers.</p>

<p>The old man turned to the window beside
them, and watched the stations and the
people as the train went on. He saw the
news upon the placards, flaring under the
flaring lights. He recited the headlines
slowly to himself. They were associated
dimly, he knew not why, with anxiety;
they distressed him.</p>

<p>Then there was a little darkness and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
rumble, and he heard the name of Norwood.
He recognised it at once, and got out, and
stood irresolutely at the gate. The collector
took the ticket out of his hand, and smiled.
Mr Burden looked at him fixedly, wondering
at his smile, and felt for a moment an angry
wave of emotion. He took this man also for
one of his enemies.</p>

<p>But a muddled feeling of pleasant association
came after. He took him foolishly for a friend,
and smiled and nodded in reply. Then, by
pure instinct, such as animals have, he found
the way towards his home.</p>

<p>He came up that familiar road, his head
reeling, and a bond, as though of iron, oppressing
it within; and, as he walked, he
suffered some dull ache continually. His slow
steps jarred him; and now and then those
pulsating throbs that are Death’s artillery preparing
his attack, hammered at the walls of
his being.</p>

</figure>

<p>He kept to one line of the pavement to make
more sure; and once he thought: “Perhaps I
am drunk.” For it flashed twice on him that
he was something different from himself; and he
mixed with a night forty years gone, when he
had drunk a whole bottle of some kind of wine.
He heard again his father’s anger; and it
seemed to him, in a fantastic way, that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>about to meet that anger now—after all those
years.</p>

<p>The functions of humanity were breaking
down in him: memory, connection, harmony.
Oh, poor Mr Burden! He had not known
what was meant by the preachers when they
preached; he had not known what was before
him when they talked of the Soul. Mr Burden
had called it immortal in his recited creed, and
very right had he been in so calling it, and he
was to prove it right in astounding trials, but in
so doing quite to pass beyond the meaning of
his word or theirs.</p>

<p>He came up that familiar road: he saw the
gates of his own house—they both stood white
in the evening. Habit (or ritual) the mistress
of men sane, the good nurse of the last hours,
carried him stumbling beyond the first gate.
He passed the lodge, and, stumbling still, he
reached the steps at his door. Here the
old man would have sat down, as beggars do,
to rest, had not habit still sustained and preserved
his manhood: for never in his life had
he done so strange a thing as to sit upon the
doorsteps of a house.</p>

<p>It was his house, and he was master of it.
He felt in his pocket for a key, and found one.
He tried the door with it; but the key was too
large. Many thoughts at once confused him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
for he was troubled by Pain and Mortality:
Pain and Mortality wrestled with his failing
manhood, to mount, to ride, to conquer. But
they were not in the saddle yet. He was
determined to open his own door. He fancied
many things at once. That his door had
changed, or the key. Of his home and himself
he was still sure; but his key and his door had
already entered that world where all things
common change and mingle, and where some
other things, less known, emerge quite fixed
for ever. Of his home and himself, he was
still sure. His key and his door were already
passing; himself and his home were, alas! to
follow.</p>

<p>As he grated at the door, a faithful servant
of his, a woman of the name of Kate Hatteras,
heard him, and ran and opened. He would
have told her the miracle of the door and of
the key, but Pain—now grown into the whole
of himself and wrestling hard, a power that
knew its aims—Pain constrained him. He
groaned, and his servant supported him deftly
with her laborious and dutiful arm, and there
flashed between them that good bond of long
acquaintance, and Charity came into this house
and visited its dying master—the first of the
last angels. And, after Charity, there came
those three great spirits, whose Hebrew names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
I never knew, but which are called in our
language the Design, and the Mercy, and the
Justice, of God.</p>

<p>Charity and the old servant helped him up
the stair, soothing him; he would have still
spoken of the key and of the door; he smiled
with smiles that were those of a child or of a
man in extreme old age. Then his pain returned,
and he groaned; for the pain was in
the head, where is the citadel of a man besieged.
His keep was taken.</p>

<p>Once, during that last little pilgrimage, upon
a landing, he stopped, and tried to speak some
senile syllables. He wished to thank his companion
courteously. No one else had been
directly good to him and to his dissolving
humanity in all these terrible hours; but, in
the midst of his attempt, the key returned to
him. He mixed the mention of it into his
speech, frowned a little, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Come, sir,” said that admirable woman,
“come along; you’ll be better, sir. Don’t you
take on; now don’t ’ee”; for she had been
born away from towns, and her duty, her service,
her honour, her hard work, and her kind
of English, were all one thing.</p>

<p>So he took comfort, in spite of his pain, and
her help was his support; nor had he any other
friend, from that moment until he died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>Mr Burden was put to bed, not only by this
servant, but by another named Elizabeth, and
by the knife-and-boot boy too, whose daily task
was indeed accomplished before nine, but who
commonly remained against orders till eleven,
that he might enjoy communion with his kind.
And all these three, Kate Hatteras, Elizabeth,
and the knife-boy, were awed in the presence
of this good man, whom God had made and
preserved, and was now taking back from them,
and from Upper Norwood, and from England.</p>

<p>The burden and the grotesque of their task
wreathed up into the sublime; they felt like
travellers over whom a mist is lifted until they
see, startled, the majesty of great hills before
them. Their souls were raised by the sharp
apparent nearness of those awful gates, through
which it was their high destiny also to pass
at last. They saw revealed for another (they
themselves had caught the revelation), the
things which each of us is born to see, each at
his own time, upon his dreadful day.</p>

<p>Kate Hatteras, resolute and exact, left the
boy to watch, called a messenger by telephone,
sent him to a nursing home near by, and, finding
a cab, directed it to fetch, not this or that
celebrity, but a doctor of the place in whom
she had some confidence. Within an hour, she
had in the house a nurse of some age and experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
but insufficiently refreshed with sleep;
there came next all manner of appliances, and,
soon after, the young doctor, nervous and
smiling rhythmically, who went up to the room
and gave Death a long particular name.</p>

<p>But Death could have no need of definition
here. He was present with his most ancient
titles, dominant upon a throne, ordering that
infinite vast wherein the narrow walls of one
poor human habitation were not seen, so tenuous
were they. His armies at a summons filled
the place all around: He was in his court and
power.</p>

<p>The servants were bidden by Kate Hatteras
to go and sleep. The doctor wrote some useless
thing, and left it for the morning. It was
past midnight. Kate Hatteras lay down in
the dressing-room near by, where, some few
days before, the consultation had been held;
she lay down dressed, and slept, and dreamt
of a lonely shore where twilight stretched out
endlessly along dull sands by a silent sea. But
next door, in his bed (and above him some
text or other in a frame) lay Mr Burden, her
good master, in the agony of that last steep
beyond which, they say, is an horizon.</p>

<p>He muttered incoherently, with pauses of
silence between, and the nurse, though lacking
sleep, yet thought it her duty to watch. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
September night was chilly; a fire was lit.
She sat rigid and staring at the fire, till, in a
longer spell of silence, her head drooped; and
she living, her living body in spite of her will,
fell unconscious into repose. But round the
dying man were other companions.</p>

<p>Now this, now that, out of the long past
was with him; persons and things all trivial.
He spoke twice of an order—then he would
bid a clerk write something ... to whom?
He forgot the name ... he forgot the name.
He complained of his memory; then he sighed
a little, and was still.</p>

<p>In a moment he turned, and began his
muttering again. To many friends, long dead,
he spoke of the key and of his honour, and of
... of ... he sought for a name that would
fit at once a traitor and a lost friend, something
evil in the world;—some spirit or other.
Perhaps a son. The effort strained him; he
groaned again and was silent. One fixed and
harassing perplexity recurred. There was
something being done against his will at home;
some quarrel of judgment: the children surely—or
was it a servant? His wife was there by
the bedside, renewing some ancient domestic
difference: ... but there! he was willing to
yield. Anything, anything to cool the press
of fever that was gaining upon the turmoil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
within him: yet he wished her nearer to him
and understanding more, for he was very ill;
and he kept on whispering: “As you will,
my dear, as you will.” Then, almost aloud:
“Don’t go! ... don’t go without settling it,
my heart!” But she was gone.</p>

<p>Mr Burden opened his eyes: he knew that
he was awake: he saw the ceiling plainly, and
the stucco pattern of it, above the dull light of
the falling fire. His wife, the real picture of
her, rushed into his mind; he knew that she
had gone that very moment, shutting the door
and leaving him. He could not move, for
something had snapped, and all was changing;
he felt himself utterly alone.</p>

<p>Loneliness caught him suddenly, overwhelming
him; wave upon wave of increasing vastness,
the boundaries leaping, more and more
remote, immeasurably outwards with every
slackening pulse at the temples. Then it was
dark; and the Infinite wherein he sank was
filled with that primeval Fear which has no
name among living men: for the moment of
his passage had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>
<p>Mr Burden’s head jerked a little to the right,
his jaw fell, his hands twitched and grew rigid.
Mr Burden was dead.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The dirty light grew in the east of the world,
and lit without hope the labour and despair of
the city; the masts and spars of the ships a
long way off in the docks showed delicate and
true. There was a little streak of murky rose
which faded, and, without, one cameo noise
and then another led on to the life of a new
day. A bird among the black branches of the
ruined smoky trees, a footfall in the road outside;
a few more moments and the sound of
wheels. It was Cosmo coming home.</p>

<p>His subdued, but rather husky voice, as he
paid the driver, was carried on the rare morning;
he dropped a coin to the pavement and it
rang. Even the shaking key in the lock could
be heard, though he turned it softly. He was
careful for his father’s repose, as he had always
been when he came home after a night of
pleasure with his equals. He pulled off his
boots, not without many blunders, and went
up the stairs noiselessly, holding the banisters
well. He reached his room above, and lay
down at once to sleep, half dressed, the sleep
he needed.</p>

<p>An hour later, when it was broad day, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
nurse in the room with the dead man snored
fitfully, stirred, and awoke. She started suddenly,
as she looked round at what was in the
bed. Then her long experience composed her,
she did what she had to do, and went into the
next room, not liking to be alone. Kate
Hatteras woke at her touch; and they watched
together; and only when they saw that the
time had come did they rouse the household.
The fires were lit for breakfast to be cooked,
and someone called Cosmo and told him what
had fallen in the night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two days after, with reasonable pomp, they
restored the body to the earth, in that part of
the cemetery at Norwood where lay the vault
he had purchased: just beyond the sections
consecrated to the Roman Catholics and the
Jews. Already, for some fifty-three hours, his
spirit had returned to God who gave it.</p>

<p>Thus did they bury Emmanuel Burden, a
dealer in hardware; and his son inherited his
wealth.</p>

<p>I have no fears for him at the Judgment
Seat. He had borne with affection for more
than twenty years the common trials of domestic
life. He had brought up three children to
maturity. He had dissipated nothing of his
health or patrimony; he had increased his fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
by sober and by honest means, and with
it in some part the wealth of the country which
he adored. He had voted consistently as he
thought best for the interests of Britain, supporting
Mr Gladstone’s Administrations until
the fatal year of 1885, and, since that date,
concerning himself for the success of the
Unionist or Conservative candidate. But Mr
Burden is dead, and I do not quite see who
there is to take his place.</p>

<p>Honest Englishman and good man—I wish
I could have written of him in nobler terms.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
